DFB head Grindel sees no reason for Özil comeback
Berlin - DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no return to the national side for Mesut Özil.
"This is not just a question of being talked about at any particular time, of why he appears to have experienced one thing or the other in the ways he has described in his statement", said Grindel on the Bild-Zeitung "Phrasenmäher" football podcast.
In spite of the debate surrounding Özil posing for pictures with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which has dragged on for several months, Grindel regrets the decision of Özil, who has 92 caps, to retire from international football.
"I would have been happy if Mesut had continued to play for Germany.
Up to a certain point in time, I still believed that he would", said Grindel.
The 29 year-old announced his retirement from international football in July and, in justifying his decision, said that Grindel did not defend him against racial abuse during the World Cup.
The DFB head repeated his criticism of Özil for refusing to hold discussions with head coach Joachim Löw and general manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to put anyone under pressure, but he knows that, in football, "when someone leaves a team or switches clubs, they discuss it with their manager and I think it is a shame this discussion did not take place earlier".
Linz: garden shed burns in allotment area
At 2:13pm, Linz fire department were alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Due to the fact that a high voltage line runs directly above the allotment, danger was imminent.
Professional firefighters went out to find the shed fully ablaze.
Practically the entire roof had to be removed and all debris had to be cleared as necessary.
The owner of the burning shed said that he had plugged in a battery to charge at midday.
This may have been the cause of the fire.
In any case, the fire department found that the charging device was in the area of highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire, as well as the exact cause, is yet to be determined.
The damage may prove to be significant, as the owner of the shed had many collectibles in his garden shed.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What made Lindsay Lohan commit this extremely strange act?
It appears she wanted to take away the children of a reported refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan, 32, star of "Herbie: Fully Loaded", livestreamed how she attempted to take a Moscow family's children away from them.
The US website "TMZ" reported the story and published a clip of the livestream.

She provides no proof of this in the clip.
Lohan can be heard saying "the whole world is watching right now" as she continues to pursue the family down the street.
She appears to be attempting to take the children from their parents.
Eventually, the angry mother appears to have had enough.
She appears to turn round and strike Lohan in the face.
The tearful actress, holding her cheek, then said how shocked she was.
At this point, it is unclear what motivated Lohan to do this.
Landing on Ryugu: this mission has "Mascot" on the asteroid.
The "Hayabusa2" probe began in Japan in December 2014.
The probe purportedly came so close to the Ryugu asteroid that material from the surface was able to be vacuumed and brought back to earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.

British Conservative party conference
Closely guarded - the Tory party conference
Birmingham become the stage of a power struggle.
The main topics on the agenda are foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is being overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit hardliners, headed by ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum on new country name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have come to an agreement
Macedonia is the name of a state in the Balkans, Macedonia is also the name of a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been in dispute over the name issue for years.
Now they have come to an agreement.
From now on, the state of Macedonia will be called North Macedonia and this Sunday, Macedonians will go to the polls to vote on the name change. Whether this will be the end of the issue remains to be seen.
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Not Him") - the man in question is Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood is split.
Thousands marched in the streets across several cities to protests against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Brazilian Trump" has presented himself as an anti-establishment candidate and is currently ahead in the polls.
His closest rival is Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Worker's Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment taking longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still at work", said Chief Development Officer Peter Mertens to industry publication  "Automobilwoche".
Audi chief Rupert Stadler, who has been detained and is currently suspended, had announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"We expect all engine/gear combinations to have been checked by the first quarter of 2018", he said at the time.
Mertens now says: "At the start of July, we reached an important landmark in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was set up in September 2015 after the outbreak of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent company, Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "drastic organizational changes" to prevent another such scandal from occurring.
The VW supervisory board deferred a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will hold further discussions on Tuesday.
The investigatory authority accuses the Audi chief of having approved the sale of diesel vehicles with falsified emissions ratings after becoming aware of emissions fraud.
They accuse him of having known of, or ignored, the manipulation.
Sales director Bram Schot is currently managing the company as interim chief executive.
Schot told the "Heilbronner Stimme" that the conversion to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption testing standard would result in production losses at Audi.
He sees a falling demand for limousine models, such as Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced  in Neckarsulm.
"The sector is a difficult one in its own right", he said.
Schot is focusing on electromobility.
15,000 reservations have already been made for the e-tron, Audi's first electric vehicle.
Grindel running for re-election - Lahm to join DFB board
Mainz (dpa) - In spite of the criticism coming his way after Germany's elimination from the World Cup and the Özil saga, Reinhard Grindel wishes to run again for the office of DFB president.
"I am doing my job and I aim to do it to the best standard possible", said Grindel as a guest on ZDF's "Aktuellen Sportstudio" on Sunday morning.
Running for re-election is part of the job, and that is what I intend to do.
And a candidate has to see whether the support is there.
In his own words, the association chief would, after securing the hosting of Euro 2024, find it "remarkable" not to "be working on the future project".
Grindel has been association chief since April 2016, succeeding Wolfgang Niersbach after the latter resigned amid bribery allegations surrounding the awarding of the 2006 World Cup.
He was elected for his first full term of three years in autumn 2016.
The next vote will be held in the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, future Euros organizer Philipp Lahm will be a DFB board member.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues on the DFB board agreed that he should, in the future, give advice on the board in this role and is invited to contribute his know-how in sporting matters", said Grindel.
He refrained from commenting on speculation that Lahm could succeed him as DFB head.
As a result of the saga surrounding the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan,  Grindel expressed his wish for a national player of a non-migrant background to be made a DFB integration ambassador.
Currently, this post is held by the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who originates from Cameroon.
"If someone from a non-migrant background makes an impact in football and society and says "this is an important issue, we have to do something about it", this would be an initiative to give us a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration counts", said Grindel.
Smart weight loss with smart scales
For four weeks, I have been the owner of a new toy.
It is a weighing scale which not only measures my weight, but also my body fat percentage.
It can also display bone and muscle mass.
It can also calculate your BMI, but this measurement does not really tell you anything.
It gives no indication if I have replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: comfortable opening wins for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started the new Basketball Bundesliga campaign with an impressive win.
Last year's runners-up cruised to victory against Science City Jena 112:55 (52:31) and played first-class basketball for 40 minutes.
New arrival Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer for the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
National player Johannes Thiemann (18 points), signed from Ludwigsburg, also had an impressive competitive debut in front of a crowd of 9,113.
Ex-champions Brose Bamberg won their first competitive game under new coach Ainars Bagatskis 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best player for the away team, with 24 points.
Würzburg player Gabriel Olaseni had 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalists MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated Frankfurt's Fraport Skyliners 83:76 (41:34).
New German national player Karim Jallow was the most prolific shooter for John Patrick's team, with 24 points.
EWE Baskets Oldenburg secured an important victory to start their new season.
The Braunschweig Basketball Lions enjoyed a clear 100:64 (48:30) win for their first two points.
New playmaker Will Cummings shone for Oldenburg, scoring 25 points.
The Braunschweigers, whose new majority owner is NBA star Dennis Schröder, were disappointing after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 scoring run ensured a clear margin of victory.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Previously in his three-day visit, Erdoğan attended meetings with Chancellor Merkel and President Steinmeier.
Criticism of Germany
In his speech, Erdoğan demanded that the German government extradite followers of the Gülen movement and take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow PKK or Gülen sympathizers to cause our citizens unrest and damage the German-Turkish friendship", he said.
Parts of Cologne city center were cordoned off for the opening of the mosque.
Thousands of police officers were on duty - some in riot gear.
The Ditib Islamic association has been criticized as a front organization of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": music against poverty: stars, boos and scary moments
Musicians including Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for more action against poverty and disease in a concert in New York's Central Park.
"Get involved, wherever you can", said Mendes to a festival crowd of around 60,000 on Sunday night.
Thank you for coming here, it is a dream come true.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with tassels and a golden microphone.
I am nervous, I'm sweating, but it is okay, because I am here and I am ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives from governments, the UN and aid organizations appeared on stage at the festival, which ran for several hours.
During the concert, there was a moment of fear when many concertgoers, mistaking the noise of a falling metal barrier for gunfire shots, took fright and tried to flee.
There was a brief moment of panic as people ran about.
Organizer Hugh Evans said that seven people were injured in the confusion.
New York police and musician Chris Martin took to the stage to calm the spectators.
"Nobody is trying to hurt anyone", said Martin.
You are all safe here.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were - as they are every year - free of charge.
Those wishing to get one had to read and share texts, videos and photos on the global fight against poverty and disease.
There were cheers and applause from the audience for the various musicians and actors - but there were boos for Republican senator Jeff Flake.
Flake, together with his Democrat colleague Chris Coons, declared support for gender equality.
On Friday, however, Flake supported the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge in the Senate Justice Committee, offending many women in the process.
At least three women have made allegations ranging from sexual assault to rape against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake demanded an FBI investigation into the claims after the two women, who claim to have experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him in a lift when he was on his way to a committee session.
"You are more than welcome to take the lift with me any time", Flake said to the crowd of spectators at the New York concert.
Press Freedom: Federal Government Defends Expulsion of Journalist
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish President Recep Erdoğan.
In the chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who now lives in Hamburg, put on a t-shirt that read in both Turkish and German "Freedom for Journalists" and then went into the front row.
The t-shirt was not the problem Seibert told the Bild am Sonntag weekly newspaper.
It was instead because of disturbing the press conference.
The journalist's behavior resulted in massive agitation, which was entirely unacceptable.
He therefore prompted the removal of the journalist by the man's own personal bodyguard.
Seibert said political demonstrations during press conferences at the chancellery were not allowed.
It is completely immaterial whether the protest has to do with a legitimate concern or not.
Rules are rules.
Numerous journalists are imprisoned in Turkey. 
Many of them are accused of allegedly spying or supporting either outlawed political parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish government holds the movement responsible for the failed attempted putsch on July 15th, 2016.
Some of the convicted journalists are facing many decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: at the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was imprisoned.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel have attracted attention.
Indeed they were set free and were allowed to return to Germany, despite the fact that neither of their cases has been fully resolved.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
Florian David Fitz - a man normally seen by his fans as fresh and good looking.
You have to take a second glance - yes, it really is Florian David Fitz.
The famous actor was in Hamburg - and enjoyed a wild night!
Hamburg - The NDR-produced talkshow "Ina's Night" is known for its merry discussion at the bar of the Hamburg harbor pub  "The Haddock Post".
Presenter Ina Müller raises her glass to her guest - some with beer, some with wine, others with stronger drinks, to relax the mood and to loosen tongues.
Quite a few celebrities have a dose of Dutch courage for the compulsory sing-a-longs.
A further episode of the popular talkshow was recorded on Friday.
The guest this time is actor Florian David Fitz, famous for his roles in films such as "Männerherzen" (Men's hearts), "Terror - Ihr Urteil" (Terror, or judgement") or "Der geilste Tag" (The best day".
However, the trip to the far North did not do the Munich native good at all.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - in it, his face is really wrinkled and his eyes are two narrow slits.
And a selfie on the bed shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill - he just has an almighty hangover.
For his fans, he posted - probably to be taken humorously - the things he had learned: "Rule No. 1: NEVER go on Ina's Night.
Rule No. 2.: Never drink black liqueur
Or spritz.
And the egg nog that Ina produced at half two in the morning - leave that alone too.
You can tell the amount of alcohol the 43 year-old drank on his face.
His fans posted tips on dealing with the aftermath.
These ranged from instant broth, fish rolls and - probably the most efficient - headache tablets.
Others just amused themselves with the appearance of the normally attractive film star.
It is currently unknown how Ina Müller coped with the aftermath of the previous night's drinking session.
As she has been presenting the show since 2007, however, it's probably the case that the 53 year-old is much more used to it...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa marred by vandalism and trash
The start of the 36 kilometer-long track cycling path in the Red Riding Hood Forest in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Solutions to the rampant vandalism are being sought, but nothing concrete stands out as of yet.
Shards of glass, cigarette butts, litter and trash, broken bins and discarded notice signs - for a long time, this has been the scene at the starting point of the bike path and its seating area on the Haaße hill in Treysa.
For the showpiece bike path in Red Riding Hood Land - it is more than an inglorious sight.
The local section of the German Bicycle Club (ADFC) in Schwalmstadt has been dealing with the issue for much longer, according to the city's cycling officer, Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The issue has already been discussed in the cycling advisory board.
No solution has yet been found.
Suggestions ranged from the removal of the seating area to the regular emptying of waste bins and the cleaning of the area at the start of the ascent.
"I think that the time has come for the latter - regardless of any further action that may be taken", said Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) states that he has also raised the issue in the local advisory board.
It is not just rubbish which is a concern for cyclists and residents - the seating area is a regular meeting spot for youths at the weekend.
These youths are not only loud, they also cause damage: posts are ripped out of the ground, rubbish bins are broken, signs are bent and seats are daubed with dirt.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert claims that volunteers have frequently cleaned up.
These actions, however, are just the proverbial drop in the ocean.
People are angry that the resting area of the Treysa bike path has become a meeting point for drunkards.
"This point of the Haaße hill is the focal point of the entire bike path", confirms the cycling officer, who is currently occupied with the new water wheel in Ziegenhain which is being declared open today.
"If the bike path suffers the same fate - the price will be high". 
One other idea is the video surveillance of the hill: "Maybe this will raise the stakes of misbehavior on public property.
However, this would then need a police patrol to come promptly.
Wüstenhagen wants to develop the Haaße hill.
It has to be made more appealing.
Up to now, the use of the bike path has been very pleasing.
Tourist marketing has potential for development.
Compared to others in Germany, our bike path is really good" according to the ADFC members.
ADFC Susanne Klippert believes that situation on Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as very dangerous.
There is no turning lane on the Haaße hill.
When traffic is busy, it can be the case that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between two lanes of traffic", she explains.
For sporty riders, this is no problem, but it is a different matter altogether for the elderly and particularly for children.
Music Contest in Kulturbahnhof: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the Lake
The first call for a music contest was a success for creative reasons and to bring people together.
Reading "Your Song for Hiltrup" the appeal from Hiltrup's neighborhood campaign reached out for a "music contest for big and small, as well as experienced and inexperienced musicians".
A contest "with a nod in the direction of the friendly Hiltrup family," as it was formulated by Karl Franke.
Actually, it would almost be like a family get together with coffee and cake provided by volunteers from the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formation of musicians will perform, from a one-man band to a huge ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with his guitar, longtime Hiltrup local Rolf Ihmig (originally from Albachten), the nine from the "Hiltrup Starcolors", 3 members and 3 generations of the Trenkamp and Claus family, an ensemble from the Lummerland Kindergarden and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, as district mayor Joachim Schmidt explained, should be a new feature.
We have never experienced such a thing in other neighborhoods.
How are the lyricists connected to each other?
Of all the locations, Lake Hiltruper and the Market Promenade are most often mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig shortened the name of the promenade in his Schlager song "Kö von Hiltrup".
Also the Kulturbahnhof was appreciated.
Again and again it had to do with the way people experienced each other at the various locations, particularly Alvin Jasic.
When they were changing from one band to the next, Karl Franke kept the short breaks lively by talking with the performers about their work.
That was how the audience found out about Humber and how he actually used to study chemistry, even though he now gives guitar lessons.
Franke could report that sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann had most recently performed in Ludwigshafen on the program with Barclay James Harvest at a large BASF event.
Meanwhile Alvin Jasic posted multiple times on YouTube.
"It doesn't have to do with winning," said Franke.
All participants actually received a gift from the Hiltrup gastronomy.
For the jury's favorites, there was still something special - that more people could also hear their music.
Sound engineer Schemmelmann put on an entire CD by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied.
Various additional musicians recorded a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup Schlager, whose musicality particularly impressed Franke, as well the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and their two teachers, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle, playing guitar and cajon.
Like all of the others, the children performed one last time in the finale - even without electronic accompaniment, they sounded, "really good", according to Franke.
The jury judged performers on aspects of originality, their connection to Hiltrup, as well as how catchy and memorable their melodies were.
On the jury sat the Westphalian Music School's Gisbert Keller, the KvG Gymnasium's Andreas Klomfaß and the trade association's Oliver Ahlers, as well as head of the neighborhood campaign's Jan Kaven.
The neighborhood campaign used the even to mark the occasion of the ten year founding of the organization.
They saw the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the nearly full Kulturbahnhof.
The word game: "Decrypto" in game test
The players form two teams who sit across from each other.
Each team has a screen, on which there are four cards with key words, which - using the old trick with the red film - one can only make out when they are stuck in.
This guarantees that the other side cannot read what is there.
For example, on the cards, from left to right, are the following words: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Dice.
4. Tight". 
These are the terms that have to be found.
It's not the terms themselves that have to be worked out as such, but codes.
Each player in a team takes turns being the coder.
The coder receives a code card with number, let's say "3.4.2" .
In "Decrypto", you don't so much try to work out the words behind the film, but the codes.
In this example using this order, the coder has to describe the words "dice", "tight" and "window" in a way that enables his team to get the correct order without the other team getting it, because the other team wins if they break the code twice.
The coder makes a note and reads aloud: "throw" for the dice, "loose" as the opposite of tight; something like "party" or "Prague" would have gone here because the coder paid attention in school and knows the window lintel from their school days.
It goes round by round, team by team.
The teams do not know the terms the other team has to decode, but can piece them together from every clue that team's coder gives.
So the clues have to be as far-removed from the original terms as possible, but not so far removed that they make things too difficult for the team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing of all about "Decrypto" is the rulebook.
Players will have to spend a long time reading it before they eventually get to play.
The demonstration video at decrypto.info makes things easier.
But once people get going with this game, they will be amazed at how much emotion this inconspicuous game conceals.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite so coherent as its predecessor and genre king "Codenames", which also makes use of a secret agent theme for a game of few words, but is better for games with small groups.
And for people who just want to play to pass time and not for points, then a two-player version is also possible.
Kulmbach: Man gives Nazi salute to police and harasses guests in pub
A 48 year-old man gave Kulmbach police double cause to act on Saturday night and Sunday morning.
First of all, he gave a Nazi salute to a passing police patrol in the upper part of town, later on he appeared in a pub in the same area, where he harassed patrons.
After he did not follow police orders to leave, the drunken man had to spend the night in a Kulmbach police cell.
Now sober, he has to answer criminal charges for the use of gestures of organizations proscribed by the German constitution.
Pressig depot was home to the heavy goods locomotive
The Pressig rail depot was the hub of the Franconian forest for decades.
1991 saw the end of a piece of railway history.
"You could hear the sound of buffers coming together all over Pressig", reminisced Georg Dinkel, who is archiving the history of the town and the railway station.
Nobody was annoyed by the sound.
The brakes screeched and the wagons rattled.
It was a pure railway sound experience.
These statements sum up Dinkel's home town of Pressig.
Nowhere in the Franconian forest has been so deeply influenced by the railways.
It was the starting point for the steep mountain route to the north, which reaches its peak in Steinbach am Wals at about 220 meters above sea level.
To climb to this peak, heavy goods locomotives were required, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway repair workshop with 21 engine sheds, an apprentice workshop and an overhead line and railway maintenance depots.
"At the heart of everything was the turntable, which, after conversion work in 1899, had a diameter of 18 meters", explains Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 year-long railway worker.
From the Pressig railway workshop, brought under the control of Bamberg in 1968, locomotives ran on the local routes from Pressig to Tettau, Ludwigsstadt to Lehesten, Stockheim to Sonneberg and Kronach to Nordhalben.
On 15th July 1950, the "Volksblatt" news reported that the workshop had a staff of 160 men; at the time, 13 steam locomotives and 8 electric locomotives were stationed at Pressig.
The electrification of the route in 1939 minimized the need for heavy goods locomotives.
From 1977, they were only used for freight.
As recently as 1991, at least 10 000 wagons were shunted per month.
In 1982, part of the workshop was demolished, with the rest demolished in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is a shame that nobody thought of a better use of the location, even as regards freight transport".
On Pentecost in 1989, Nuremberg railway chiefs organised a grand celebration in Pressig to mark "50 years of electrification between Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There was a crowd of 10,000 here", remembers Georg Dinkel.
Shortly afterwards, it was all over.
On 1st June 1991, the last 30 men were laid off and the Pressig shunting yard was history.
"The shunters and brake fitters did the hardest jobs in transport", remembers Dinkel.
Every mistake could have fatal consequences.

Kerber with winning start in China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have joined Julia Görges in the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing.
Kerber defeated the French player Kristina Mladenovic 6:2, 6:2.
The world Number 3's next opponent will be either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund was leading 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina, when the Number 13-seeded Russian retired injured.
The Swabian player now faces a match against Estonia's Anett Kontaveit.
A special exhibition was opened in Mettelehrenbach at the weekend for the series "Art and Pleasure".
Organizers and visitors were relieved to see the perfect weather, as the special "Wind Chime Performance" preview was opened on the grounds of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It has been organized under the umbrella of the tourism organization "Around the Walberla" as part of the "Art and Pleasure" series.
It opened its gates in its 15th year.
A large number of visitors proved the level of fascination with the exhibition.
21 pieces from 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann greeted artists at the opening of the preview.
He has been on-hand right from the off.
As has Volker Hahn, who has made his mark as chief organizer and as an artist.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation just a few days ago.
However, in Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he left his responsibilities in capable young hands, with good future prospects.
Both have played an active role in the past - in the selection of artists and in helping design flyers.
Commemorative Art&Pleasure 70-cent stamps designed by the pair are also available this year, at every art station.
This year's poster "Dancing", designed by Volker Hahn, can be bought for eight euros.
Hahn is pleased by the high interest shown in the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was recruited to provide musical accompaniment.
Upon walking through the bounteous garden, it becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Wind Chime Performance" solemnly challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately brings it out in a playful manner.
There are works of art made of metal and ceramics, which often bear colorful accents.
Right at the entrance to the estate, the visitor sees the "Tree of Happiness" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened with paint and playfully adorned with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum pipes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining the bushes in the background, the object is given a heavenly glow and entices people to dwell around it.
Barbara Waschneck, from Eckental, has committed herself to the 15 year anniversary Art & Pleasure with three-dimensional letters.
There are many pieces, moving in the wind.
Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The wind, the heavenly child" at the half-way point.
And at the end of the exhibition, Volker Hahn presents his multi-colored fantasy piece of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The "Wind Chime Performance" invites the visitor to meander through the diverse art exhibition.
The special exhibition will be open until 31st December 2018.
5 Years MGV 68 Albachten: The singers celebrate a 50th birthday
1968 - that was the era of protests and the student movement.
Those from Albachten also aired their disapproval.
At least five of them.
They were not resigned to the fact that after their church choir "Cäcilia" disbanded, there would be no singing life in their neighborhood anymore.
In the meantime, they became legends: on a bench in Tinnenbusch the MGV 68 Albachten was founded.
That was 50 years ago.
The anniversary will be celebrated on a large scale in the "Meeting House".
"It is going to be full today," predicts their leader Jürgen Holstiege, and he will likely be proved right.
There were 150 guests, which was a real success for the singers from Albachten.
Specifically for this anniversary, the celebration of the group's founding was brought back to life.
For many years it was a tradition, but then at some point there was a break.
With perfect timing, the annual celebration was there again for the 50 year anniversary.
It would be an elegant ball, so formal attire was announced beforehand.
The guests did not sit in rows in the "Meeting House", as they normally would, but instead there were tables set up to make it more comfortable.
Periodically, they were encouraged to move: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln turned up the excitement and guests were encouraged to get out on the dance floor.
The singers from MGV 68 Albachten had the honor of creating a great mood with their sounds.
Suitable for the occasion, cheerful songs were presented.
Perfectly programed was: "Such a Day as Beautiful as Today".
The song "Wine of Rüdesheim" was appropriate to the glass of exquisite wine sitting in front of everyone.
An allusion to another cool beverage, they sang "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin for hops.
Secure in his hands, the choir director Richard Homann, one of the five that used to sing in Tinnenbusch, again led the singers.
"It is just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an effortless manner. He made it a masterly performance." Besides, it was not only a concert of men singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C", whose repertoire included crowdpleasers from the 20s to the 60s, were also invited to perform.
Finally, there was also poetry.
Singer Theo Weber was up until 3 in the morning at his writing desk coming up with his own rhymes.
Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodious poems.
Alongside the other events, there was a big raffle.
The proceeds will finance the Albatros Youth Center's visit to an all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: Women's Third League: USC II wins top class derby against BW Aasee
The recently-promoted team marches on.
Three games, three wins - the reserves for USC Münster under the leadership of Axel Büring find their way in the third league.
With no hint of shyness or fear, the independent team do their thing.
And they are doing well with a scoreline of 3-0 (25-15, 25-23, 26-24) against crosstown competitor BW Aasee.
"That was not crystal clear, but we made an impression," said the reasonably satisfied manager.
BWA's manager Kai Annacker agreed immediately, "That was a loss that we can live with.
We are not disappointed." The opposite.
With the game out of the way, the spirits were high at a belated birthday party for Ronja de Boer.
The result is, in fact, an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests scored a set point.
"When they hit their mark like that, the tide of the game can change," knows Büring from many years of experience.
Ultimately, USC showed their routine strengths and were able to achieve their goal.
"It is clear to all of us in such a derby who is standing on the other side.
That does not break our neck.
There were phases where I saw really good volleyball," said Annacker and clearly he was not wrestling with the 0-3 result, as he returned to the business of the day.
Where the independent team is headed after these three games is not something that can be predicted.
"It is too soon for any of that," said Axel Büring.
Only in one thing does he feel certain, as he said, "The third league is at an incredibly high level.
This cannot easily be compared to regional league volleyball." When they were in the fourth league, they did not even want to look down.
As long as we do not get dirty in the next weeks, we will have to start looking up.
The first conclusion can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday, they play for the first time at Emlichheim.
Aasee plays again on October 14th in Essen.

On her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt that she was good enough for her husband
Heidi Keller became a star on the "Dreamboat".
She now claims that the series might have been partly to blame for her split with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dreamboat" made Heide Keller (76) famous, on 1st January 2018 ,however, she disembarked for good.
The series which made her a celebrity could have played a role in the failure of her marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013) to whom she was married for ten years.
"It could also have been a cause.
Because I was brought up doing this kind of work, traveling the world alone with a suitcase and a lot of people I worked with who were impressed with me regarded me as their equal", reveals Keller in an interview with "Bild am Sonntag".
At first, she was merely known as "the wife of Hans von Borsody" but "Dreamboat" changed all that.
From then on, the journalists only called her.
"I am not sure if he was too happy about this".
She thinks that her ex-husband might have been jealous because of this but "like a lot of men, Hans shied away from discussing problems and feelings".
Keller says that she always"tried to do what was best" for Hans von Borsody and that "he did not want to know about my fears or vulnerabilities".
"Simply put: I sacrificed myself", she continues.
She always felt that she was "not good enough for him".
He thought that I was an independent woman, which, in reality, I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and bold on stage.
"I wanted our love to last forever".
After her failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller tied the knot again, "even though I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time".
The day before the registry office ceremony, I sat crying in the cloakroom, wanting to call it all off.
Her marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why did I never succeed with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller says she imagined love to be "like it was in the films.
Unfortunately, this dream is not reflected in reality.
I approached love with far too much naivety".
The moth, which makes regular appearances in the nightlife of Zurich, home of NZZ, ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Although or moth is not exactly a moth, it is a little shady.
And the bright glitter in which a green carpet is dipped on Sechseläutenplatz overly deceives him.
But it's the film festival, where a few celebrities wish to enjoy the limelight.
On this late Thursday evening, he veers over the square to relieve himself in the "Aquaclean WC Oasis".
This is the name of a public lavatory facility which is sponsored by a large sanitary company and is making its bow at the festival: The public lavatory on the ground floor is making every effort to exude a luxurious ambiance.
However, for some reason, the men's stinks to high heaven this evening.
Let's get out of here - onto the other side of the street: invited guests who have just been entertained to the highest level by the opening film "Green Book", are celebrating the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey building, as they do every year.
Its name fits this film festival perfectly: the works shown originate from all over the globe.
When writing an article about this festival, you have to stop yourself from overdoing it in order to prevent the article becoming a form of surreptitious advertising for its 190 corporate partners.
The moth is making a ribbon with the tentacles given it by its fairy godmother, and two brawny bouncers even beckon him inside generously.
Inside, the guests cluster, dancing to live music way beyond midnight, or dance to DJ beats, yelling to each other to the music, washing down exquisite nibbles with champagne.
In the basement deli, oysters await slurping mouths, alongside, the incomparable raw ham, Culatello di Zibello is cut fresh, and a chocolate fountain flows.
And the best bit of all: all the sales shelves, full of exclusive produce, have been left untouched for the occasion.
It's been this way for years, and it appears to work, without too much going missing.
One reason why you have to love this country!
The moth studies the sign by the escalator: "If you are wearing a long dress, please take care on the escalator".
If these were two commands, one of them being to wear a long dress, it would mean he had messed up on the dress code.
But it's a conditional construction,and it has definitely saved lives.
In the household goods department in the upper floor, the moth knocks an espresso cocktail called "Golden Eye", fitting for the festival award.
This mixture, a promotional item for Nespresso, might not win the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been in this company's commercials for years, is also not here.
But over there is a face, in amongst the local celebrities, the cash desk and the kitchenware, that any observer in the know will recognize; Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
One of his leads might be close by.
And believe it or not: soon Viggo Mortensen, looking like a choirboy at the age of sixty, walks through the crowd.
Nobody talks to him, nobody gawks at him, people squint furtively.
It's precisely for this very kind of reservedness, which is prone to being misinterpreted as inhibition, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates win in Mexico with Cumbia dance
Manager and ex-star player Diego Maradona is delighted after his side's win.
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona appears to have taken to life well in his new surroundings in Mexico.
After a 2-0 win for his team, Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57 year-old danced to Cumbia rhythms in the dressing room with one of his players as can be seen in video footage which went viral as early as Saturday.
A 15-second clip taken by a team member shows Maradona, cheered on by his players, dancing in a yellow jersey.
The Mexican second division side beat Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted "always behind my lads, always" into the camera.
The 57-year old has been managing the Mexican side since the start of September.
Handball: 1st Club League: ASV Senden "Devastated" at Last Minute Collapse
Swen Bieletzki, manager of Handball Club League ASV Senden could hardly believe it as he described "Such a bitter defeat". The players in his care were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29-30 (12-14) loss - their fourth loss in a row - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2. 
There were definitely phases, like in Steinhagen and against Hüllhorst, where they did not play badly.
Only in the opening period "did we totally fall asleep" complained the ASV manager.
The hosts quickly led the score at 8-1 and even with the early timeout that Bieletzki took, nothing could be done.
"Then suddenly a jolt went through the whole team," is how Bieletzki summarized the second quarter.
At the break, they were only two points down.
Of all the players, Senden's top scorer Marius Hintze scored again and again.
From the visitors' perspective, he was even better after the break.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst scored the equalizer to make it 15-15, and after that the visitors led for most of the rest of the game.
Four minutes before the final whistle, they still held a seemingly comfortable three-goal lead (29-26).
And then?
The intervention of impartiality.
Bieletzki tried, as he often does, to find someone else to blame.
However, the 120 second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received, "was a joke."
LIT had the last laugh and scored four more times before the end, while the decimated ASV were unsuccessful in their last attack.
The boys fought hard, they defended well against seven men but missed scoring opportunities.
Only they cannot do much with these empty compliments.
"Now we need a damned win," swore the fed up Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for bone fragments
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18 year old woman from Naila in the Bavarian district of Hof, the police are searching for the woman's remains.
Emergency workers dig up a street near Marxgrünn on Saturday.
In the process, the road surface and more layers underneath have been cleared away, as described by police and the district attorney.
According to these new findings, the missing woman apparently could not have been buried far from her place of residence.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
Investigators at the time could not rule out criminal activity.
Since last year, both the local police and the district attorney in Hof have revived the investigation due to recently obtained information.
Along with scientists at Technical University Munich and the Bavarian monument protection authority, investigators come across the conspicuous findings with the help of a ground radar.
Thanks to the help of scent hounds searching for human bones, they were able to narrow the search down to within a few meters.
The results of the digging were made public in the course of the afternoon.
Hacker attacks on millions of Facebook users show the dangers that lurk online.
However, there are things that people can do to protect themselves.

In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed promptly and installing anti-virus software on a computer does no harm at all.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has avoided being forced out of his position leading the billion dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settled out of court regarding a legal dispute about misleading posts on Twitter, in which Musk could have lost the right to head publicly traded companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla each have to pay 20 million dollars. In addition, Musk has been forced to step down from the chairman's job for three years, which in Germany is a position comparable to the head of the supervisory board.
In contrast, he is allowed to stay on as the company's chief executive.
The settlement, which still has to be approved by the court, acknowledges wrongdoing by neither Musk nor Tesla.
The SEC filed suit against the world famous manager in federal court in Manhattan.
Musk, who also heads the space travel company SpaceX, is the public face of electric vehicles and presently is valued at more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not aware of any wrongdoing
Musk declared he had done nothing wrong, and that he was saddened and disappointed at the lawsuit.
He is to have always behaved in the name of truth and transparency with investors.
On August 7th, Musk wrote to his 22 million Twitter followers that he might take his company from the stock market and pay 420 dollars for each share, and that he had already secured the funding.
In doing so, Tesla was valued at a total of 72 billion dollars.
Musk later backpedaled: Tesla would stay on the stock market.
Following the agreement, now Tesla has to find a chairman from outside the company, appoint two independent board members and establish a committee that oversees Musk's communication.

Polls: 46 per cent do not want Merkel as Chancellor in 2021
After the quarreling of recent weeks, the Grand Coalition has plumbed new depths in the polls.
In one poll, the SPD have fallen behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - In an Emnid survey for Bild am Sonntag, the AfD has overtaken the SPD across Germany for the first time.
In the weekly poll for the opinion polling institute, the AfD is 1 point up on 17 per cent, while the SPD has fallen 1 point to 16 per cent.
The CDU and CSU are also down one point, coming in on just 27 per cent.
This is the lowest value the CDU/CSU have had in the Sunday survey.
The Greens are on 15 per cent, the Left on 11 and the FDP on 10.
If a Bundestag election took place on Sunday, according to Emnid, the governing parties, the SPD, CDU and CSU, would only get 43 per cent of the votes.
The Sunday poll results mean that the Grand Coalition has lost its majority in polling for all the major research institutions - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently receive from 43 to 45 per cent of votes (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
In the 2017 Bundestag elections, they got 53.4 per cent.
The band is also large for the other parties: the AfD, the second-largest party in many polls, comes in at 15 to 18 per cent.
The Greens have 12.5 to 17 per cent.
The Left have an average rating of 10 per cent and the FDP 9 per cent.
For statistical reasons, polls of this kind have a margin of error of plus and minus 2 to 3 per cent, depending on the vote proportion.
Support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has fallen sharply since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 per cent of people believe Merkel is the right person for the office of Chancellor, according to the Emnid poll on behalf of BamS.
According to the poll, only one in two people (50 per cent) want the Grand Coalition to last until the next scheduled Bundestag elections in three years, 41 per cent support a new vote.
In another poll published on Saturday, clear losses of popularity for Merkel were evident.
Germans are also split on the question of whether Merkel should run for the leadership of the CDU again.
According to Emnid, 47 per cent are in favor, 44 per cent.
64 per cent of CDU supporters would support her candidacy, 35 per cent would not.
Hook up with Aldi: bargain match making
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that romance is dead in the age of Tinder should try talking about turkey at Aldi.
Munich - In the era of digital "hook-up culture" with apps such as Tinder, the supermarket chain, which is the Number One place to get to know your true love, seems like something out of a romance novel.
Yes, that's right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargains in the rummaging rack and your favorite dessert is still a better bet for producing future grandchildren than swiping right.
The Tinder app has the reputation of being not such much a contacting app, but a salacious mating market.
We have tested it out: how do women react when men make a proposition right in the first message?
Here is the surprising result.
There is real Hollywood love story potential when a lost-then-found-again plot precedes the joy of love.
If a man messages his beloved using the email bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it's highly reminiscent of Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant & Co. - romantic comedy at its best.
The person who placed this advert in an Aldi branch we know will find it most welcome to find her dream man with whom she talked about "30% reduced organic turkey meat".
For her faith in the magic of old-fashioned dating, she has definitely deserved her Hollywood-style happy ending.
Billerbeck: 500 bottle caps for a life without paralysis
Since the start of the school year, the Ludgerischule has been participating in the campaign "Bottle caps against polio - 500 bottle caps for a life without child paralysis".
Polio is the short form of poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by the polio virus.
The condition, which was once known as "infantile paralysis", can cause child paralysis and even death.
Polio has been eradicated in Germany, however, there are still three countries where polio is still present.
According to the press release, the trigger of poliomyelitis, the polio virus, can only be prevented by injection.
Soccer: Reus and Zorc demand peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - Michael Zorc, sports director of BVB, and captain Marco Reus have demanded an end to the discussion about Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That is not doing the guy any good.
And it is not doing us any good either," said Götze's friend Reus after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen on tv channel Sky Sports.
Zorc had already emphasized the point before the game.
This is not an easy situation for him personally.
Football: Eberl: no rush in contract negotiations with Hecking

"But, at some point, we will definitely sit down and talk", said Eberl on Sky on Sunday evening.
Football: Regional League: Brisker Performance of VfL Wolbeck Against SC Altenrheine Builds Courage
There have been moments in this still young season that have been hard on Alois Fetsch.
Maintaining a taciturn demeanor, Regional League VfL Wolbeck's manager initially retreated inside himself to ponder the lack of motivation on the pitch.
All of that is history, though.
In the meantime, everything is running smoothly again on Brandhovenweg.
Fresh proof is the 1-1 result on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, who just barely missed out on promotion last season by the smallest of margins.
Yes, I am very satisfied with our performance.
"We closed off space from our opponent and put pressure on them for the ball.
That was impressive," praised Fetsch when talking about his players. He singled out individual players after the match to say "Thank you" for their resolve against such ambitious opponents.
In this case, the manager had to change the entire team's formation after 26 minutes of play.
After Nico Frerichs' injury (muscular problems), Luca Rehberg replaced him and the team seamlessly shifted from a 4-4-2 formation to 4-2-3-1 with Niklas Thewes up front in the striker's position.
Wolbeck had significantly more ball possession in the first half.
As well as more chances.
However, Frerichs (17th minute) before his injury, the substituted Luca Rehberg 26th minute) and Jan Schroer (38th minute) missed out on going into the lead.
Their opponents nearly had their revenge in the 41st minute when both Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer each made a surge for the goal, but the goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved himself a master of his craft.
After the break, VfL brazenly took control of the game.
Thewes narrowly missed scoring from 18 meters.
After 58 minutes of playing time, Thewes got the ball into the area, but Schroer was too late to convert.
Despite the substitution of Miles Geske, manager Fetsch could not get enough new life on the left side of the pitch.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer took down Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, an indirect free kick was awarded to the home side 18 meters from the goal.
The fouled player took the penalty himself and showed how dangerous he could be in such situations.
Westhues' shot with his right foot rocketed into the lower left side of the goal out of view of the defense.
With 20 minutes still on the clock, there was still a long way to go.
And then in the 80th minute, VfL captain Florian Quaback was hit on the hand by the ball in the penalty area.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed at the penalty spot.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the opportunity and he converted the penalty (79th minute).
Wolbeck had to survive more anxious minutes in the final stretch, before Geske scored the winner 12 meters from the goal in the 87th minute.
It would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75 Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26 L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66 Geske) - Thewes

Helicopter crash in Kottingbrunn
A helicopter crashed on the airfield after its landing approach.
The four occupants suffered mild injuries.
The drama unfolded at Kottingbrunn airfield at 2pm on Sunday.
Police confirmed to oe24 that the helicopter experienced turbulence when landing.
The heli was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and ended up on its side.
Police, paramedics and fire crew were called immediately.
A large contingent of first responders arrived at the scene of the accident.
As a precautionary measure, an emergency air ambulance helicopter was also called into action.
Occupants only slightly injured
Fortunately, there was little harm done.
The only damage was to the helicopter.
The four people inside the helicopter only suffered light injuries and were able to return home unaided.
The exact circumstances of the crash are still unknown and are currently being investigated.
According to fire department spokesmen Franz Resperger, there was a small incipient fire which was quickly put out.
Allbright Foundation report: women still a rare thing on company boards
On 1st September, only 8 per cent of board members were female; this is according to the "Power of Monoculture" report, which is due for official release by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and which has been previewed by the German Press Agency.
"Companies will have to structure themselves differently, otherwise, international competitors will leave them behind", said foundation director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain and Sweden, all-male company management teams - with just a few exceptions - are a thing of the past.
Germany's lack of female executive board members makes its companies less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different business culture.
The slow increase in women on DAX-listed company boards is solely down to the positive changes by companies in the German mid-cap index (MDax).
However, according to data from the Allbright Foundation, only 6.8% of executive board members are female.
This value was at 3.8% the previous year.
In the 30 DAX-listed companies, which had set the pace in previous years, the number of women on executive boards stagnated.
Latest figures show that 26 women were on these executive boards. 
"I am certain that DAX companies will begin to commit to recruiting women in the coming year - in their own interest", said Ankersen.
RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signaled - without entering into a voluntary obligation - that they are prepared to increase the proportion of female board members from "zero per cent".
The picture looks slightly different for supervisory boards: the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If this many women were brought onto company boards year on year, we would achieve the 40 per cent mark by 2023", the report stated.
Some even sell at a loss: luxury cars: which manufacturer makes the most money per car?
Ferrari make the most money.
The Italian carmaker earns 280,000 euros and makes 69,000 euros profit for every car sold.
Big cars mean big profits: this slogan still rings true, most of the time.
The luxury manufacturer which makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: how much do the luxury manufacturers make on every car sold?
The economics professor and "car guru" Ferdinand Dudenhöffer has looked into this question.
His study reveals massive differences.
In the first half of the business year, Ferrari made 69,000 euros on every car sold; in contrast, Jaguar Land Rover only makes about 800 euros on every car and Tesla and Bentley make losses on every car sold.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are sitting pretty with average prices of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes.

Torch procession marks opening of Abtswind wine festival
The Abtswind tourism board opened its wine festival with a torch procession.
The tourist board is hosting the wine festivals, which line the ascent of Rehweiler Straße every Saturday in October, for the 60th time this year.
To commence the festival, organizers marched through the town to the festival site to the sounds of the Wiesenbronn brass band.
The chairman of the tourist board, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe greeted guests in the jam-packed festival tent. "60 years of organizing an event like this is an extraordinary achievement for a place with a population of 800.
It's something to be proud of", said Starz when thanking volunteers.
Wine princess Lisa II. raised a glass to guests from the stage.
"It's great that, once again, so many people have made their way to Abtswind". Later, the "Die Troglauer" band provided the atmosphere.
On Sunday, which was also the day of the Abstwind fair, the board set the prices for drinks to those of 60 years ago to mark the 60th anniversary.
There will be a festive evening celebration held for the 60th wine festival on Friday 5th October in the Haus des Gastes, before festivities continue in the festival tent one day later.
In Bonn: Emergency doctor's car crashed into a taxi.
An emergency doctor's car is on the side of the road badly damaged.
As a result of the collision between the emergency vehicle and a taxi a 27 year old passerby was killed.
Emergency doctors are supposed to help people when they are called; they should really save lives.
One such drive intended to save lives ended with the death of a 26 year old.
Bonn - A 26 year old female pedestrian was killed in the collision of an emergency vehicle and a taxi.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and her driver were all seriously injured, according to the police.
With emergency lights on and siren blaring, the 46 year old driver of the emergency vehicle ran a red light.
In the intersection, he collided with the taxi, who had a green light.
After the collision, the emergency vehicle skidded and hit a light pole and a tree.
At the same time, the car also hit the pedestrian, who died on the scene.
Driver of the emergency vehicle and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62 year old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency vehicle were seriously injured and trapped in their automobiles, which they were freed from by rescue workers.
Although she was also injured, the 29 year old emergency doctor was able to free herself from the vehicle, but there was nothing she could do to save the pedestrian. 
Another emergency doctor, who had been called to the scene also made a last minute attempt, but to no avail.
The three seriously injured people were brought to hospitals.
In close coordination with Bonn's public prosecutor's office, the police is determining who was responsible for the accident.
Manchester United  lose again - things get uncomfortable for Mourinho
After their humbling exit from the League Cup, Manchester United lost in their seventh game in the Premier League.
Man U lost 3-1 to West Ham United, but it was the manner of the defeat that will be talked about.
The scene in the 74th minute, when the returning Marko Arnautovic made it 3-1 to West Ham, summed things up; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had got the Red Devils back in it.
When Mark Noble made a pass, the entire United defense stood still, waiting for offside, giving Arnautovic all the time in the world to fire past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the lowest point of a display which had been disappointing over long periods.
The situation at United's city rivals, Manchester City, could not be more different.
The Citizens, managed by Mourinho's fierce rival pep Guardiola, enjoyed a comfortable 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling secured the breakthrough for the home team.
After the hour mark, Sergio Agüero secured the team's sixth win in seven games after a one-two with the previous goalscorer, putting his team at the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer top of the table
Three days after their 2-1 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri took part in Liverpool's 1-1 Premier League draw against Chelsea.
Just as he was in the League Cup game, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best player for the Londoners.
The 27 year-old's 25th-minute goal was the game's only goal until the final stages of the match.
Shaqiri, who replaced Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, just missed a chance to make it 1-1 in the 70th minute.
Daniel Sturridge showed how it is done with a curler in the 89th minute.
After the Reds started the week with a perfect record, they failed to beat Chelsea for a second time.
First of all, the London side knocked Jürgen Klopp's team out of the League Cup, and then the Blues knocked Liverpool off the top of the table with this draw in the league.
Like City, London clubs Tottenham and Arsenal celebrated 2-0 wins, at Huddersfield and against Watford respectively.
The fans of the Gunners, for whom Granit Xhaka played 90 minutes, had to wait until the 81st minute until breaking the deadlock against the surprise package from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart was unfortunate to bundle a cross from Alex Iwobi into his own goal, and just two minutes later Mesut Özil sealed the game with his third of the campaign.
Arsenal moved above Watford in the table thanks to their fifth win in a row and now sit just behind fierce rivals Tottenham in fifth. Newly promoted Wolverhampton Wanderers continued their impressive start under manager Nuno Espirito Santo.
With a 2-0 win against Southampton, Wolves went five league games unbeaten and are now eighth.
VW's core brand absent: Paris Car Show to open amid diesel debate
The Paris Car Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Not on the agenda, but ever-present: the diesel scandal and the struggle with car bans and retrofits just won't go away for the German car giants at the industry meet-up in Paris.
From next week onwards, they will present their latest models along with competitors from across the world at the 2018 Car Show in the French capital.
Diesel no longer plays the role it once did here.
Nevertheless, the potential conversion and retrofitting possibilities for diesel car owners in Germany currently being negotiated with the government in Berlin may still be an important issue - behind the curtain at any rate .
One big name will not be in Paris: Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries of the Volkswagen group will attend, but not the VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and are showcasing their first fully electric models: the Audi e-tron is due to come onto the market at the end of the year, the Mercedes EQC model is due for release in 2019.
Both vehicles have already been officially presented.
The BMW iNext is only due to come out in 2021.
The new 3 Series will take center stage in Paris.
In total, more than 250 companies will attend the show from 4th to 14th October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and a range of mobility service providers and software companies will be present, with one hall provided for each industry.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years, alternating every year with the IAA in Frankfurt.
One million people attended in 2016.
At least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a strong earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Dozens of people are still missing.
More than 500 people are currently reported injured.
The island was rocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake measured 5.9 on the Richter scale, the second 7.4.
Telephone wires and roads have been destroyed, the scale of destruction has been massive.
The tsunami swept in from the west coast of Sulawesi after the quakes.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will go much higher.
The current numbers are from Palu alone.
However, many other communities along the west coast of Sulawesi are affected.
Around 150 bikers attend church service in Werdohl
Biker pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne held a service for motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking on Sunday.
Werdohl - On Sunday, the square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to bikers.
But the main thing on the biker's agenda was the church service.
Frank Schröder is the "biker pastor" of the Westphalian Evangelical Church and is responsible for the pastoral care of the petrolhead bikers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorbike service (MoGo) takes place at Nordhelle House on the last Sunday of the month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers congregated on Sunday to attend a church service like no other.
The fireballs were lined up in front of the church entrance at 10 o' clock.
The early biker's session was the first item on the agenda; coffee, cake and a hearty currywurst were available for the nourishment of attendees.
Alongside the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian bikers' group from Gummersbach, also attended.
The sermon was held by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided musical accompaniment.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes calm, poetic tones", said pastor Frank Schröder.
This undoubtedly marked another first in the history of the motorcycle church service.
Füchtorf's heritage society celebrates with large festival - with apples and milk
Borisch was also active at the actual campaign day.
They fed their hungry guests with freshly-made apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also piqued great interest.
He unpacked his apple press and demonstrated every step of the process from ripe apples to apple juice to rapt onlookers.
Then Hartmann-Niemerg took the children to the field and let them fill his huge hopper with apples they had collected.
With a little muscle powe they made a finely ground product from apples.
Still not many of the children could have imagined that this stuff could be made into a tasty drink.
Yet that important step in the process could also be observed on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed together in forms and covered in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked layer after layer of the apple mixture, that looked like shredded materials, on top of each other.
Thanks to a bit of thoughtful technical support, the last step of the process was not at all difficult.
The freshly pressed juice flowed freely into a large barrel.
Indeed Füchtorf's farmers also had ready-made specialties on offer.
Here is how he opens his "treasure chest" and presents the newer wine to the older visitors.
There was obviously a high demand for the good drops "Made in Füchdorf".
In the most comfortable atmosphere, parents were able to talk with each other, while their children were not only watching the process of apple pressing. Instead they could also explore the bouncy castle.
Füchtorf's brotherhood of former soldiers was also actively manning the booths with carnival games.
In coming years, the heritage society will also offer more campaign days.
However according to Gregor Krützkamp}s insistence, the location of the events will not take place in the Heimathaus in the heart of the asparagus village.
Instead there would be an attempt to find an appropriate farmhouse to house the festival.
The next topic is obvious: eventually it will be all about the milk.
4-1 defeat to Frankfurt: Hannover lose their fourth game of the season: "a bad situation"
Frankfurt/Main - After his team's fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, manager André Breitenreiter gathered round than his downbeat Hannover 96 and gave them words of encouragement.
However, there were few positives in the bottom side's 4-1 (2-0 HT) at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It is a bad situation but we have to get out of it as a team, said Hannover 96 player Pirmin Schwegler and added: "Of course, it is disappointing, because we put in so much effort".
The winless Lower Saxony side, who scored a consolation through Florent Muslija in the 86th minute, are bottom with two points and, on current form, look like relegation material.
In contrast, Frankfurt, inspired by the terrific Ante Rebic, celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka (36 minutes), Rebic (45 +1 minutes), Jonathan de Guzmán (59 minutes) and Luka Jovic (89 minutes) scored in front of a 46,300 attendance for the DFB Cup winners, who moved into mid-table with 7 points with a successful dress rehearsal for their Europe League tie with Lazio.
Croatia's World Cup runner-up Rebic, making his first start of the season, was involved in almost every Frankfurt attack, the Hannover defence being unable to deal with him.
With his tempo and perseverance, the striker, who had suffered from a post-World Cup hangover, showed why he is one of Frankfurt's key players.
Alongside Rebic, Brazilian player Allan, on loan from Liverpool, also made his first start for Frankfurt, who came bursting out of the traps.
The first chance came when Lucas Torró had a header deflected onto the roof of the goal in the 17th minute.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was in a great position but was stopped by Hannover's Brazilian defender Felipe, a recent replacement for Kevin Wimmer (back injury).
The host's opener felt inevitable, and was fully deserved.
After a corner had been cleared, Filip Kostic lifted a ball into the box, Haller flicked it on across goal and Ndicka stretched out a leg to score.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender, who arrived from Ligue 2 side AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt added to their lead before half-time.
Haller passed to striking partner Rebic who ran through and gave Hannover goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
Hannover manager Breitenreiter reacted to his side's weak showing at half-time and brought on two forward players, Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony side showed more courage going forward, but they lacked creativity in the final ball before another Frankfurt goal struck.
The Hessen side were much more efficient in front of goal.
Just after the hour mark, Rebic went on a run and played the ball in to De Guzmán, who tapped into an empty net.
The remainder of the game was played at exhibition pace by Frankfurt against their overwhelmed opponents, with Jovic scoring again one minute before full-time.
Morlaix Square becomes a party location
Würselen - Despite the cold temperatures, spirits were high for the Oktoberfest celebrations in the town center.
Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter opened the 185th 
Munich Wies'n celebration in the last week of Oktoberfest with two strikes of the keg in front of an audience of millions.
Geisingen: Geisingen Christians celebrate Holy Cross Day
Geisingen's Catholics celebrate Holy Cross Day on September 14th or the Sunday after.
The celebratory mass takes place in the town church and is followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church accommodates a wounded Jesus from the Thirty Years' War, who, according to the legend, was shot at by a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed from the shot wound.
A large-scale pilgrimage to the wounded Jesus followed, which resulted in the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
To this day, the church has not been completed; only the altar has been built, it seems the missing nave passes through the trees.
In his sermon, pastor Adolf Buhl reminded listeners that the cross is a sign of hope, solace and life.
In spite of its importance for Geisingen parish, the church service was poorly attended.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place, with the church element of the Holy Cross Day celebration concluding with the final sermon.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has invited people to the secular element of the festival choir in the Catholic rectory.
Members of the choir fed hearty meals to the attendees, along with a broad selection of cakes, and, perfect for the weather, farmer's ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church; on behalf of the parish, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger detailed the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone work and windows and the pending building measures which will continue on into next year.
After the scaffolding stood for some time, it was possible to ascertain the damage more precisely and invitations to tender could be made more specific.
it is clear, however, that the renovation work will cost more than planned because the damage which has been present for some years has worsened; even more damage has been detected by means of the scaffolding.
The roughcast work on the base has been completed, the natural stone work is set to commence before winter and it is hoped that a good half of this work can be completed this year.
Official opening: new home in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller Counseling Center has opened a new home for people in disabilities on Münsterblickstraße.
All those present at the opening ceremony agreed that Münsterblickstraße now had a "very special building" for people with disabilities.
The specific architectural features of the new building have finally been revealed to the twelve wheelchair users, who have been accommodated by the Donau-Iller Counseling Center for some time.
Architect Rudolf Bader included wider corridors, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas in his design.
The initial plans started about eight years ago as the former US Army officer building was chosen as the site of the new benchmark for handicapped residents: "The building had aged and the facilities were outdated", explained Bader.
In 2016, excavators moved in to pull the building down.
According to the architect, the aim was to make the new build as welcoming and bright as possible so that the residents could feel at home there.
Donau-Iller Counseling Center opens new home
The counseling center spent around 4.6 million euros on the new build.
The federal state of Bavaria donated 2.4 million euros and the district of Swabia gave 450,000 euros.
According to the architect Bader, the building work was completed on time and within budget.
Jürgen Heinz, head of the counseling center, thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and fire-safe building was not always an easy one.
Nonetheless, planners and builders have built a home which meets a range of requirements and which gives its residents freedom to move without the help of others.
The head of the Swabian Social Administration, Gertrud Kreutmayer, echoed these sentiments: "The home is designed to the particular requirements of the residents who require assistance to be mobile". 
Kreutmayer said that the home achieved a good combination of livability and functionality.
She continued: "It's a good thing that the building is in this location; it's not possible to acquire sites like this anymore".
The new home on Münsterblickstraße provides almost 1,500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, who are themselves made up of three groups.
Counseling center head Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees who are all paid at the standard rate.
Germany: Schwesig Laments Differences Between East and West
Berlin -  Before Reunification Day, SPD Chairwoman Manuela Schwesig called on all of her fellow citizens not to accept the discrimination of former East Germans.
There are differences that are still painful even after nearly 30 years of reunification.
We should not be content with these differences," said the president of the federal state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to the weekly newspaper "Tagesspiegel on Sunday".
The goal of equal living conditions in all of Germany must remain possible to be achieved.
It is still unacceptable that eastern Germans on average work longer hours than western Germans, but are paid 15 percent less.
"I cannot explain that to anyone after nearly 30 years of German Reunification," said Schwesig.
North Korea: can this cute dog bring the conflict to an end?
It is hoped that the one year old Pungsan hunting dog can oil over troubled waters.
-In an attempt to thaw relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean president Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
According to Moon's office, the two dogs, both about one year old, will be with their new owner as early as Thursday.
They crossed Panmumjom border area together with three kilos of dog food intended to "make it easier" for the dogs to settle into their new home.
The dogs, with thick white fur, pointy ears and brown eyes, are regarded as loyal and intelligent.
They are a national symbol of North Korea.
The gift of friendship was announced by the North Koreans at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September.
At the summit, both leaders agreed that the two countries would enter combined teams at international sporting events such as the 2020 Olympics and would jointly apply to host the 2032 Olympics.
Kim agreed to close the Tongchang Ri rocket testing facility as part of the reconciliation process.
Austria's eventful history in 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the centenary of the foundation of the Republic of Austria, which has been commemorated for almost ten months of this memorial year, a wide range of books has been released which offer answers to this question, primarily on the basis of the last one hundred years.
In his magnificent "Picture Book", due for release on 1st October, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archive, provides a different perspective.
A new week, a new opportunity for the government
Back to business - this is the Grand Coalition's unofficial motto for the working week, which starts today.
Not one interview or speech has gone by without the Chancellor or her ministers from the CDU, SPD and even from the CSU invoking the "back to business" motto like a mantra.
This may have led some people - craftspeople, doctors, cashiers and other gainfully employed people - to justifiably ask what else politicians have been doing that requires them to get "back to business", but the slogan remains.
If the Federal Government is at the stage where they can get back to their task - governing - then they should not be kept from doing so by arguing over words.
Monday will probably reveal whether the CDU/CSU and the SPD can manage to get things done together after the provocations and humiliations of the past week.
The leaders of the government parties are meeting in the coalition committee this evening.
Chancellor Merkel now wishes to hold these meetings regularly in order to nip quarrels in the bud; this is one lesson from all of the arguing.
However, issues such as diesel retrofits and skilled worker immigration, which have a potential to cause conflict, are first on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to escape with just exchange premiums, SPD and CDU, however, think the manufacturers have a duty to technically retrofit older diesel cars.
While there appeared to be progress on the subject of the diesel crisis over the weekend, the CDU/CSU and SPD are still far apart when it comes to skilled worker migration.
The SPD is demanding a right to remain for asylum seekers in employment or training.
The CDU/CSU is strictly opposed to such a "shift" from the asylum system to the labor market.
This means that arguments between the coalition partners are set to start up again - was it ever going to be any different?
It is not three like-for-like parties who formed the Grand Coalition, but three coalition partners with some very different views on society and priorities.
It's good to argue.
Without arguments, a diverse society marked by occasionally conflicting interests can never move forward.
But in order to be constructive, debate should never be blown up into a matter of all-or-nothing for purposes of party strategy.
This is politics, not theater.
The CDU/CSU and the SPD should argue - but they should always bear the everyday lives of ordinary people in mind.
What is achievable and beneficial to a large group of people?
This question can bring pragmatic solutions to both the diesel and asylum residency rights issue - and can thus gain trust.
This is the one thing the main parties must now fight for.
Pilz examine working hours under Hartinger
Minister under scrutiny
Has the employment minister - of all people - violated employment law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
When presenting the social insurance reform a fortnight ago, the social minister herself reported exuberantly that her staff had worked "day and night" on it.
Pilz List mandatory Daniela Holzinger was amazed by the words of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) and she is now set to request a discussion of the issue in parliament.
She is assuming that "the minister was merely expressing enthusiasm for the work of her team and was not actually indicating any breach of applicable employment laws on camera".
Nevertheless, she has questions which will enable Hartinger "to dispel any such notions".
Police rip up street in search for woman's corpse
Marxgrün - for a long time, police had been reluctant to admit it.
Now it has been confirmed.
Police have been digging up a road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is to be blocked off in Marxgrün until Monday.
It had been assumed that detectives had used a sniffer dog.
The dog, specially trained in picking up the scent of old human bones, was able to narrow down the area to a few meters' space after several attempts with its guide.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and Bavaria's supreme monument protection authority, they found ground irregularities in the area of the road.
Criminal investigators and the state prosecutor have been investigating the case of a missing person for over a year.
A bike path by Marxgrün was repeatedly blocked and examined using sonar devices, because investigators suspected that this is where Heike's body was buried while a road was being relaid 30 years ago.
Colored powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonian anniversary 
Monday marked the first anniversary of the controversial referendum on Catalonian independence.
There were even riots beforehand.
Separatists had not forgotten the police tactics of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Clashes broke out between separatists and police in the heart of Barcelona on the eve of the anniversary of the referendum on Catalan independence on October 1st 2017.
While attempting to prevent the demonstrators from attacking national police and civil guards, Catalan security forces were pelted with colored powder and other objects.
Around 3,000 officers of the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units held a rally to honor their colleagues who were deployed in electoral districts during last year's referendum, which was declared illegal.
Attempts to prevent civilians from voting even culminated in violence.
According to Spanish reports, Catalan police formed a cordon to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces apart.
Some of the 6,000 used violence in an attempt to break through the police cordon and pelted the officers with pigment powder and eggs.
According to statements by the authorities, six people were arrested and 24 were injured.
Monday marks one year since the independence referendum.
After the vote and the decisive outcome in support of the secession of the prosperous region, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under direct rule in autumn 2017.
The then Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, fled to Belgium in exile.
Other politicians also fled the country.
Several ministers of the previous regional government and other activists remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
Direct rule was ended after the new Catalan government took office in May.
However, the new regional president, Quim Torra, insists on the Catalans' "right to self-determination".
Soccer: Upper League Westfalen: Assembled Helplessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen hold each other goalless
Rot-Weiß Ahlen remains in the same position in the table.
Also FC Gütersloh were only able to manage a goalless draw.
In front of 438 fans in the Heidewald Stadium, the bottom of the table club and the league's third worst team turned out a bewildered ensemble.
From an entertainment persective, the first half had little to offer. 
That is why if someone wanted to go get a beer or a sausage, they could do that without worry.
There was no danger of missing the chance of a goal, because there practically was none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the game's first, albeit harmless, shot at goal in the 28th minute.
The team from Ahlen had the best - and actually the first real - chance when, in the 32nd minute, Cihan Yilmaz shot from the edge of the penalty area, but it was saved by FCG's goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective move was an early substitution of a player.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be substituted due to injury, and Sinan Aygün came on for him.
After the change, both sides decided to do something about the increasingly rising boredom of the game.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel took a shot from 18 meters that went just over the bar, and after an hour of playing time even the team from Gütersloh made their first appearance on offense.
After Matthäus Wieckowicz got a hold of the ball, things moved quickly.
The swift counter-attack by Sinan Aygün's recently "crowned" Nick Flock in the 62nd minute resulted in a feeble shot aimed directly into the arms of RWA's goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In the 66th minute, they attempted a goal with a header after a corner kicked by former Ahlen teammate Tim Manstein.
RWA's interim manager Angelo Daut reacted by substituting Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy in the 60th minute and a little later Enes Güney came on for Sebastian Mützel in the 70th minute.
That resulted in - no effect.
They appeared dominant thanks to the initiative they showed, yet the team from Ahlen was unable to make a difference.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but nothing came of it.
Angelo Daut strove to stress the positive when he said, "It pleases me that we held them to zero goals." But unfortunately his team was held to zero goals, as well.
"This time we were not as dangerous at scoring goals as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent here had no desire to actually play today," stated RW Ahlen's interim manager.
Our offense, "trickled along" against a team "that only wanted to defend.
At the very least, I did not get the feeling that we were in danger of allowing a goal," said Daut.
To his disappointment, the spectators similarly did not have the feeling his team could score a goal.
For that, the teams' play was too pathetic.
Reckenfeld Thanksgiving Market: fortunately, enough Kreimers present
A pleasing fact for Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler at the Reckenfeld food bank center, the recipient of these donations.
The volunteers said assuringly: "These donations will also be used in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was a radiant blue, but the square was empty; however, this would change during the course of the day.
"It's feels nice and social, that is why we are here today" said a visitor.
Fair organizer Franz Josef Holthaus greeted visitors in a merchant outfit, with a good dose of humor as always.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stepped in for the Brockmanns, who were to be weighed against food.
Verena (the daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) fell ill.
But there were enough Kreimers.
And the "replacements" could not pass up the opportunity of providing musical entertainment to the growing numbers of visitors.
This was so well-received that some folk songs were sung later on.
"Fantastic", rejoiced Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to include the opening in his schedule.
The numbers of people taking part, predominantly from associations, pleased him.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a food bank", nevertheless, he gave his thanks for the men's choir campaign.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of everyone who worked on the stands and also mentioned September's other festivals and the "Clean Up" campaign.
Our garden town is getting a new lick of paint - an important thing.
The May wreath was taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and put in the winter quarters.
Many stands were preparing food.
Everything was on offer, from sweet to savory.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative with his scroll saw.
He had veneer fittings, beer mats with images of Reckenfeld and much more on offer.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers had a specialty on offer; "Reckenfeld honey", which was brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
Helen had another specialty with her.
Honey cake in a glass, made with my own honey, of course.
The cake was so good, little Elsa kept coming for more.
The thing that keeps the visitors here until the evening hours, even without a stage program, which the autumn festival does not have, is the conviviality.
Graffiti with a local political message: unsuccessful advertisement for skate park
Unknown people in Lengerich have petitioned for the construction of a skate park in an unproductive manner.
Graffiti about this was found at many locations, according to the city council's Jürgen Kohne in answer to the WN.
In at least once case, criminal charges of property damage were registered with the police.
Emblazoned in large block letters on signs hung in multiple locations including the Gempt Hall and the Old City Hall were four words "Skate park for Lengerich".
The manager of the hall, Michael Rottmann, reported that a message with identical text had already been found after the career fair on a sign in the stairway of the Gempt Bistro on September 19th.
Because the short message was at that time clearly only written with an Edding pen, it was easily removable.
"A few days later it was there again, but this time it was spray painted," said Rottmann,
He assumes that the sign in question will have to be replaced. 
The case has a special significance, because many bigger companies names are on the sign.
If the skate park is built, it can only be made possible through the help of sponsors.
Pledges had already been made, explained Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department Sport and Culture, however he declined to name anyone in particular.
It is entirely possible, however, that one or more sponsors are identical to the ones that were on the spray-painted sign.
For years, local politicians and their administrations have been dealing with the issue of a skate park.
After the LWL Clinic was demolished, the time began for a search for an alternative location.
Eventually, the majority of the council recommended the fire station's parking lot.
This suggestion will not be implemented, though - apparently too many factors were working against it.
An about-face followed at the end of June.
The members of the main committee and the finance committee only voted unanimously for the area at the Gutenberg School.
About the status of the situation, Jürgen Kohne said that the administration was in the middle of conrete planning.
The town council has the last word.
He is expecting a decision within the year, so that with a positive vote in 2019 the building can begin.
Air traffic congestion set to become worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg - German airlines see no blue skies on the horizon after last summer's air traffic chaos in Europe.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds, then will come the storm", said the head of the German Air Traffic Control Union, Matthias Maas, to the German Press Agency on the eve of the aviation summit on 5th October in Hamburg.
One main reason for the many delays and cancellations has been the long-known personnel shortage in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year but training new air traffic controllers takes four to five years", said the trade unionist.
There is a shortage of air traffic controllers across Europe.
Central Karlsruhe alone, which monitors upper German airspace, has suffered shortages of around 100 people.
Maas again criticized the fact that various air traffic unions had not been invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal government, member states, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in Hamburg to discuss the causes of the delays.
"If work intensification and overtime is on the agenda, then we have to be at the table", said the head of the GdF, which has many members in the federal German Air Traffic Control Association.
Maas again blamed EU regulations for the shortage of air traffic controllers.
Traffic forecasts for the control period running up to 2019 were alleged to have been far too small.
Cost specifications and staff savings derived from these forecasts by national air traffic control organizations are now affecting operative business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to campaign in Brussels for rules which prevent the skies from being "choked up" again.
The current EU regulations have been agreed until 2024 and there is a fear of even tighter regulations.
The EU is subject to constant lobbying by the airlines.
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now reaped the very thing they have sown over recent years", said Maas.
He hopes that the airlines' high delay charges have triggered a re-think.
The GdF will only agree to help improve the situation if German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "coherent package for training and future planning".
The recruitment of 120 trainee air traffic controllers over the next five years which has already been announced is reportedly sufficient to cover age-related departures.
It will not cover the required increase in personnel.
Thyssenkrupp - board vote for group restructuring
Members of the supervisory board of Thyssenkrupp have unanimously approved plans to restructure the group.
The troubled group is to separate into two independent companies, in line with the wishes of interim Thyssenkrupp chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was also appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday.
Both companies will have their domicile in Essen and will be exchange-listed companies.
No further job losses on top of those already announced in management are planned.
After two resignations, the number of shareholder representatives on the supervisory committee is just eight.
This compares to ten employee representatives.
The final decision will be taken at an AGM, probably in 2020.
The assets of one of the new companies, Thyssenkrupp Materials AG, will include the 50 per cent share of the steel business shared with Indian partner Tata.
The lifts and supply business is to be bundled in the other new company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG.
Barcelona: violence during demos by police and supporters of Catalan independence.
There have been violent clashes between two groups of protesters demonstrating simultaneously in Barcelona, with many people injured.
According to city authorities, 3,000 police officers from across Spain gathered together on Saturday, just as 6,000 supporters of Catalan independence were demonstrating.
With a large presence, Catalan police tried to keep the two demonstrations apart.
According to Catalan police, the independence supporters tried to break through the police cordon.
They attacked officers with pigment and missiles.
Catalan police said there were also skirmishes between the two groups of demonstrators.
Rescue services reported 24 injured.
The police said that they had made 6 arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had intended to honor colleagues who were deployed in the independence referendum in Catalonia, which the central Spanish government declared illegitimate.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil think it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers are paid more.
The demonstrators felt that the fact that police chose to demonstrate in Barcelona was a provocation.
"Why have they come here to protest?", asked the 55 year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez when speaking to the news agency AFP.
It's just to provoke us and to celebrate beating us up last year.
A 31 year-old Balearic policeman, who only gave his name as Daniel, denied this allegation.
"It's only natural that we wanted to support our colleagues, who were only doing their job last year: upholding the law", he said.
We are holding this demonstration in an exercise of our rights and we are holding it in Barcelona because it is a large European city and will give our voice a larger echo.
However, the policeman assured that he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke anyone".
Bug enables access to data of British ministers
A security loophole in a mobile phone app led to the personal data of ministers and Members of Parliament of the British Conservative Party becoming temporarily accessible to all on Saturday.
According to British media reports, ministers received calls from strangers once knowledge of the bug spread on the day before the Tory party conference.

Football - Juve manager praises Ronaldo's best game after top-of-the-table clash
The Portuguese star striker "played his best game tonight, alongside his 30 minutes against Valencia", said Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri in praise after the 3-1 (1-1 HT) victory of Italy's most successful team against Napoli.
The manager thought that the expensive star was the key player in the crunch clash against their pursuers, even though he did not score a goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and played well", said Allegri.
Even though we made tactical mistakes at the start, Ronaldo was great for our first goal, and we grew from that moment onwards.
Thanks to three assists from Ronaldo, Juve turned the game around after falling behind early to a goal from Dries Mertens in the 10th minute and held off their nearest challengers.
The striker, who was bought from Real Madrid, laid on a goal for ex-Bundesliga player Mario Mandzukic, whose brace (26th and 49th minutes) put the team in the lead.
And Ronaldo's header from a corner set up a goal for defender Leonardo Bonucci (76th minute), who only had to knock the ball in right in front of the goal-line.
"He provides a lot of assists", said his manager.
Of course, Allegri wants to see goals from his forward, the record Champions League and Portugal national team goalscorer.
"We have to become better at providing him with service", demanded the coach.
Juve's top scorer at the moment is Mandzukic with four goals, Ronaldo has three to his tally.
With the 100 million-euro signing of Ronaldo, the supremacy of Juventus appears to have become even more overwhelming.
They have a perfect record of seven wins in seven games in Serie A. With 21 points, the team that has won the league in each of the past seven seasons is already six points ahead of Napoli.
However, the current second-placed team, managed by ex-Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti, certainly had their chances.
But the sending-off of Mario Rui in the 58th minute, who had been warned about his conduct, settled the top-of-the-table clash.
The Portuguese received a second yellow after going in too hard on Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Napoli side", commented the Juventus coach.
Emre Can seems to have settled into his new surroundings.
The German international has made it into the Juve first team.
The player, who arrived from Liverpool, has played in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League clash against Valencia, to which Allegri made reference with his "30 minutes" comment: Ronaldo was sent off in the Turin side's 2-0 win and is suspended for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
Rapper Kanye West caught everyone's attention in a bizarre appearance on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
His performance in a water bottle costume with Lil Pump puzzled and confused the audience.
The 41 year-old announced a name change right on the eve of the release of his new album.
"From now on, you can only call me "Ye"", said the musician.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West", he tweeted, in reference to the late singer Prince, who also changed his name.
The pseudonym is nothing new.
His tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with radio station KRRL, the artist declared that "Ye" has a religious significance for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most frequently used word in the Bible, where it means "you"", said the rapper.
Football: District League A1 Münster: Finally!
Accomplished!
Hoetmar's manager Averhage makes no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game on our part.
Our opponent was simply better, and we posed them practically no problems. Hoetmar's list of players with any possibility of scoring was accordingly sparse.
Rarely can you consider it a good game if there are only two chances of a goal in 90 minutes 
Football District League A1: SC Hoetmar have been defeated by SG Sendenhorst at a score of 0-2 (0-1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
In the first round, the SG also only had two chances, but Maik Krause took the opportunity to grab an early lead from a cross in the 7th minute.
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased the lead, after excellent preparation from Krause, but he watched the chance go by.
The hosts had merely two chances: to begin with Moritz Höne failed to convert thanks to goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher, and then Jan Blome similarly met his master when the Sendenhorst keeper did the same thing.
After the break, the guests were even more dominant and had a string of good chances.
Yet Uphus (in the 49th minute), Julian Turl (in the 61st minute) and Heinz Linnemann (in the 69th minute) all failed to score.
A penalty for handball - on the goal line, Louis Kortenjann saved a goal with his hand and immediately got a red card - however, Niklas Eilmann could not convert the penalty for the guests.
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the goal line (in the 81st minute) was the game decided.
"We have been critical of ourselves before, but that was different than in the last weeks," was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: District League A2 Münster: Football Spectacle in Albachten: GW Albersloh is defeated by Concordia at a score of 3-4
"I have no idea what I should make of it," he said as he struggled for words.
"We absolutely could not get a handle on them." Presumably he meant Colby McGill and Janis Kröger playing on the wings, but it could have been all of the other players clad in green and white, as their collective offense was impressive
Despite it all, he could still laugh: "A dirty win," he said with a cheeky wink and his players relief that they had gotten three points was noticeable.
Mind you, this was a duel between two teams: Albachten is playing for the title, while Albersloh is fighting to avoid relegation.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA's manager Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
"That was by far our best outing of the season," he said.
"How we came back from 0-2, how we handled ourselves against one of the league's best clubs, that was already really phenomenal." 
It was even more bitter to go home empty-handed without having earned any points.
Leading scorer Lars Zymner gave the hosts a setback when he took the lead with his 12th goal of the season (in the 24th minute).
For this goal, he needed to make contact with the ball exactly twice in the game.
To reach 2-0, he made the perfect assist from the left side allowing Fabian Fröhning to score (in the 39th minute).
We were aware of him, but you cannot completely stop a player of his caliber.
"That was utter madness what he did!" exclaimed Lewandowski without any hint of jealousy about the quality of their opponent.
Shortly before the break, his own side managed an equalizer: McGill's free kick from the left side sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia's goalkeeper Hinkerohe to go into the opposite side of the goal (in the 45th minute).
After the break, the same player who had equalized, McGill, scored again (in the 59th minute).
From then on it went back and forth.
It was a tight, action-filled game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again with a goal (in the 64th minute), and only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann pulled level (in the 69th minute).
Despite being a man up, Albersloh could not again manage to answer Concordia's last goal (in the 80th minute).
Now we have to stay completely focused on Wednesday's game.
"The game against Schapdetten - that one we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow/Red card: Atalan (74./Albachten)
Fotball: TSV Straßberg battle to a point against leaders
Neither side came out on top in the Regional League clash between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The league leaders had made the trip expecting three points, but Oliver Pfaff's team played very well and the match ended 0-0.
Media reports: Entire Dynamo Dresden executive committee resigns
The entire executive committee of the 2 Liga club Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
This evening, several media outlets reported on a joint letter issued by the board of the Saxon club.
The club have yet to confirm the news.
The reason for the resignation is rumored to be the internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga club. 
Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of pomp
It is a good thing that he is gone.
There are few heads of state whose departure brings such relief to Germans as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish president visited Berlin and Cologne; many had felt that he should never have been invited at all.
Tutzing Evangelical Academy: famous guests and new offerings
The Tutzing Evangelical Academy is hosting around 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
In the meantime, French president Emmanuel Macron has declared his wish to receive the Tolerance Prize in person in Tutzing.
Christian Wulff 's term was too short: he was not at Tutzing's Evangelical Academy as state president.
But Wulff attended as a guest before and after his presidency.
Academy director Udo Hahn had him in mind when he proudly said: "We have hosted all the presidents and chancellors". The repeated appearances of famous people at the academy in Tutzing Palace was also a theme at the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker is participating in a conference examining the topic of spirituality from a philosophical perspective, and on September 29th, writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather, Thomas Mann.
French president Emmanuel Macron has also confirmed his attendance: he wishes to accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing in person; TV presenter Dunja Hayali is also accepting an award in another category (as reported by us).
80 conferences by the middle of 2019 - no mean feat.
"Pensions are under threat!" is part of one conference title.
"SOS on Europe's Borders" - the Academy's description of the "risky and deadly route via the Mediterranean".
"And a conference on Syria: "Barbarism without Limits".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - a war which derides all concepts of humanity". 
The conference topics range from structural racism in society and the gap between rich and poor to digitalization's radical impact on the world of work.
Academy director Hahn appeared convinced: "A free democracy requires locations where citizens can come together to seek solutions, or at least part-solutions". 
At a conference to mark the 200th
birthday of Karl Marx, some visitors will seek criticism of capitalism, while others will expect discussion of the trend "from the far-left to the center ground".
Is the Academy neutral?
"We are a 100% subsidiary organization of the State Evangelical Church", said director of studies Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100% neutral".
Musical cabaret: understanding gender with feeling - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both grown-ups and men" was the tagline for the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner in the Christuskriche in Wolbeck on Friday evening.
The cabaret artist Teubner delved into the understanding of gender, not just with humor and warmth for the depicted "woman" and "man" and all else in between, but also with music.
She played her mini guitar and violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was on the sidelines.
On the one hand, he is her male sparring partner, who chips in at the end of sentences; on the other hand, he is a talented pianist: Süverkrüp partnered Teubner so harmoniously that it's likely some wanted him to perform a solo.
And he did - Beethoven and Chopin - but in a way that befitted the central theme of the evening.
Teubner brought a paradox into play: men are pleased when they have a partner who does not open the door.
In contrast, closed doors are no use when a man is single.
The piano solo played on the same theme: what would have become of Mozart's compositions if "Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Süverkrüp then moved into improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's Symphony in G-Minor into a playful dance.
This brought rousing applause and shouts of "Bravo" from the packed hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, KulturVorOrt association treasurer, handed flowers to the singer.
However, association head Heidemarie Markenbeck modestly refrained from accepting special thanks.
She had the idea of treating the duo to a show in Wolbeck to add to their appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk has been granted permission to remain CEO of electric car manufacturer Tesla, but must step down as chair of the board of directors.
According to the US exchange supervisory authority, the SEC, he has agreed to pay a fine in the tens of millions.
The background to this is Musk's surprising August announcement that he intended to de-list Tesla from the stock exchange.
In its charge, the SEC accused Musk of making false and misleading statements.
Bruchsal
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, police have made a slight downward correction to the number of casualties.
Instead of 15 passengers, 10 are now reported to have suffered minor injuries.
All have since been released from hospital.
The French bus driver remained in hospital overnight under observation.
He was released during the day, according to a police spokesperson.
The cause of the bus accident by Bruchsal is still unclear.
The bus crashed head-on directly into a barrier without braking on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's National League: Ahlener SG barely held onto the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen team had problems, but the biggest one was the third league player who alone scored ten goals.
"Actually I was satisfied with our defense, but one of their players scored too many goals.
She was unmanageable for us," said ASG's manager Dogan Aydogdu
He was more upset about the numerous missed chances.
In conclusion, the team was lacking concentration this time.
ASG was trailing until nearly the end. At the break it was 11-12 and later (45th minute) they were behind with a score of 15-18.
Only at the end the deeper reserves of the hosts made the noticeable difference.
Furthermore, Merle Klement, playing left wing, scored "an extremely clever deciding goal," according to Aydogdu.
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: Women's Third League: Great performance by BSV Ostbevern in top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a great performance in a top game, BSV Ostbevern volleyball players returned to the elite teams at the top of the table of the Women's Third League West.
While visiting VC Allbau Essen, who only last season were relegated from the second league, the ladies in blue and white won at a score of 3-1
"That was a huge step in an uninspired season.
It is easy to play in the upper third of the league.
That is something we have achieved," cheerfully said manager Dominik Münch, after a nearly flawless performance by his team against the recently toppled table leader.
The guests dominated the first part of the game almost at will.
At 4-1, 16-10 and 22-12 it was 25-15 for the team second in the table before the winter holiday break.
Essen changed their formation to play in pairs, but it did not help them catch up in the game.
We utilized our tactics well.
Our opponent hit us at high risk, but they also created quite a few fouls.
In the second set, BSV already led with a score of 12-8. "Essen changed their formation to groups of three.
We could not withstand the pressure.
Essen surged ahead, and we were lulled a little," continued Münch.
At 18-17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr region went ahead for the first time in the game.
Indeed at 19-24 Ostbevern repelled four set points, but the fifth was finally good.
"That game was a level above us," commented the manager about the increased quality.
At first, Maike Rüdingloh and eventually Wiebke Silge carried the team with their serve, and in the third set BSV turned it around and went from 14-16 to 25-21.
Münch stated, "We played consistently and calmly."
With 7-3 and 15-13, the blue and white clad team won the fourth set at a score of 25-22.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had a superb outing.
BSV-Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea und Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Community: Mosque Opening as Missed Opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) criticized the manner in which the huge Ditib Mosque in Cologne was ceremoniously opened by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne left the German Turkish relationship in shambles, that will be incredibly difficult to repair," said the head of TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, according to Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland.
Not only the Turkish but also the German side missed out on the chance for a united and conciliatory presentation.
"Instead of taking the opportunity to sit side by side with leading German politicians and underline that Muslims belong in Germany, Erdogan used the event for his own purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The excessive exclusion of the German public "heavily strengthened existing reservations".
Heritage Society Nottuln: Offerings are already programed
After the long summer break, it is finally time again for folk festivals.
On Thursday October 18th at 7:30 p.m., Nottuln's Heritage Society is hosting the fifth Nottuln Folk Festival in the chamber room of the Alten Amtmannei.
It was nearly exactly the same day as a year ago when we had our first folk festival.
In the meantime, this event has become an established feature on the event calendar in Nottuln," with obvious pleasure says Hanns Moormann, the head of the Nottuln's Heritage Society.
That our folk festival would so quickly be established in Nottuln is something I would not have anticipated.
Regardless of the storm front Friederike in January or the heatwave in July, the chamber room of the Amtmannei was always completely full.
"The next folk festival's program will be, as always, a varied mixture of German folksongs, wandering songs, sea shanties, evergreen songs and classic German Schlager music," explains Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who regularly invites well-known musicians to Nottuln.
For the folk festival's first "birthday", Klaus Spellmeyer has accepted the invitation and is bringing his accordion.
For many years, he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from neighboring Steinfurt who played songs in Low German.
Now he is touring with an Irish folk band.
The organizers of the folk festival fondly remember when Christoph Schulz, from Emsdetten's folk festival, wowed the crowd with an international version of "Frogs in the Night" and sent them home with the catchy tune that they could not get out of their heads.
"We are counting on many happy guests to enjoy another convivial and enjoyable evening," reads the Heritage Society's flyer.
Whoever plays and instrument and wants to take part is invited to come and join in.
Because seats are in high demand and quickly fill up, it is recommended to get there on time.
The folk festival starts at 7:30 p.m. and the doors open at 7 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all remaining questions must be clarified by 24 October.
Frankfurt - Linde and Praxair have taken a step closer to becoming the largest industrial gas company in the world.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde reported on Sunday.
This means that the billion-dollar merger only requires the approval of South Korea and - the biggest obstacle - the USA.
According to an insider, Linde's approval of the sale of additional company assets has improved the prospects of the merger gaining approval.
For the merger to go ahead, any outstanding issues need to be clarified by 24 October.
From a plain orchard to ecology
The 125-year anniversary of the founding of the District Association of Gardening and Landscape Management was celebrated with a fair in the Dr. Stammberger Hall.
On 29th September 1893, a fruit exhibition in the Kulmbach meeting house provided the last impulses for the foundation of the Kulmbach District Association of Gardening and Landscape Management, and exactly 125 years later, it celebrated this landmark anniversary in Kulmbach town hall.
However, back then, it was known under a different name: in 1893, Mayor Wilhelm Flessa christened it the "District Orcharding Association of Kulmbach - Town and Region".
The purpose of the orcharding association was different to what it is today - it was purely orcharding - nobody had thought as far as flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At that time, in the age of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a beloved object of the elites", explained district gardener Günter Dippold in his festival speech.
Fruit trees were to line freeways, so-called factory gardens were established in schools.
Orcharding is still the task of around 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, with a total of just over 7,000 members.
But this is not the entirety of the spectrum by any means.
Horticulture in harmony with nature, biological crop protection, sprucing up villages and nutrition are just as important as the spreading of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The Hutschdorf "Moles" youth group gave an entertaining presentation on-stage which showed how varied a garden association's work can be.
"Youth work is urgently necessary, particularly in the digital age", said district chairman Günter Reif, and mayor Henry Schramm emphasized how important experiences in nature are for someone's life.
When we were children, going chestnut picking was a big thing; I doubt that things like smartphones can bring joy quite like it.
Schramm promised, together with county commissioner Klaus Peter Söllner, to plant two trees to mark the anniversary.
"The district association will decide where they should be planted", Söllner said and emphasized the particular importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The district association promote ecology and the beauty of gardens and green spaces in the village.
District Manager and Consultant Friedhelm Haun left no doubt that this was a genuine cause for the many gardening associations in the district.
With a picture presentation, he told visitors the long history of the district association and also talked about how vital self-sufficiency was after the war.
In days gone by, everything came from the garden, and was preserved for the winter.
By the end of the 1950s, however, the kitchen gardens had become decorative and residential gardens.
"Nature endures, it has been here longer than we have and we have to orient ourselves towards it", pleaded the fruit and nut tree expert.
This should give the gardening associations the impetus to not lessen their endeavors in keeping our country beautiful and livable.
Part of this is welcoming new residents into our associations, added the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must halt the drastic decline in the insect population - we owe this to our children and grandchildren", said Günter Reif concluding the successful festival, which was rounded off by the sound of the Thurnau music association trumpeters.

NAFTA discussions the priority: Canada's foreign minister postpones UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on NAFTA: they have made the USA and Canada an ultimatum on the agreement.
Canada's foreign minister has now made the trade agreement her top priority - and is postponing her UN speech.
Due to the time pressures in revising the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland has put back her speech at the UN general debate in New York.
Instead of speaking today, the minister wishes to give her speech to the UN general assembly on Monday, according to her spokesman, Adam Austen.
In the meantime, she will focus her attention on the renegotiation of NAFTA.
Mexican economics minister Ildefonso Guajardo had said on Friday that the US and Canadian lead negotiators had 48 hours to agree on when Canada would enter into the treaty agreed between Mexico and the USA.
The USA and Mexico agreed a new version of the regional trade agreement in August.
US president Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
Talks on a revision of the trade agreement have been ongoing for over a year.
Talks are due to end by Sunday evening local time, as the Trump administration wishes to present the agreement to the US Senate before October 1st.
Mexican president-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that if the negotiations were to fail, then Mexico would aim for a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro has left hospital after being injured in a knife attack.
The far-right ex-serviceman wanted to flee to his home town of Rio de Janeiro, according to a report by "O Globo".
After his release from hospital, it is still unclear whether the 63 year-old will make any public appearances in the last week before the presidential elections in the Latin American state.
The politician was attacked in the street during an election rally in southern Brazil at the start of September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people have taken to the streets in cities across Brazil to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Women's groups have led the protests against the ex-serviceman under the slogan of "Ele não" ("not him").
The groups have also mobilized on social media against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynist statements.
Thousands of demonstrators were expected in the economic hub of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia ,the protests converged with a rally for the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Worker's Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He is the successor to ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who has been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and may therefore not run as a candidate.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7th.
The former mayor of São Paulo, a city with over a million inhabitants, Haddad has been far behind far-right candidate Bolsonaro in the polls.
Although the "Brazilian Trump" has long mixed in political circles, he has recently presented himself as an anti-establishment candidate.
if no candidate achieves a clear first-round majority, there will be a run-off on October 28th.
Observers do not believe Bolsonaro will win a run-off, no matter who his opponent is.
Bolsonaro is known for his dislike of homosexuals and black people and his adulation of the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
His repeated gaffes shock observers.
He once said that supporters of Lula's left-wing party should be shot.
Europa regains the Ryder Cup
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just one hour away from Disneyland, Europe's golfers wrote yet another Ryder Cup fairytale before the gates of Paris.
The underdogs, captained by Thomas Björn, dethroned the USA team, the defending champions, due in part to a toothless Tiger Woods, with great shots and tremendous team spirits in front of 150,000 at Le Golf National.
Danish rock star dies after long illness
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
His producer, Jörn Jeppesen, announced on Larsen's website that the singer, aged 72, died on Sunday after a long illness.
Larsen had his wife and six children at his deathbed.
The musician had undergone treatment for prostate cancer since the start of the year.
Larsen became famous with his band Gasolin', who were enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970's.
Their songs were influenced by musical giants such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band split in 1978, Larsen enjoyed success as a solo artist.
He sold around 3 million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the highest-selling album in Denmark to this day.
Danish premier Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen as a "man off the street", who was "against everything, but in everyone's hearts".
The prime minister recalled how the anti-monarchist Larsen appeared at the 70th birthday of the Denmark's Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night in the Schuhfabrik: as loud as a pneumatic drill
"Here we will stand, with bone saws, to ignite the night with the power of a tiger" The band names alone - "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" - give an indication of Saturday evening's live rock music experience in the Schuchfabrik community centre hall: pure hard rock from three bands who know each other as friends.
After the sound check and just before the start of the concert, the musicians take the time to have a group photo together.
And without any semblance of stage fright.
The bands from in and around Ahlen  - assisted by the Oelde booking agency "Mosquito" - wowed the 120-strong crowd at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The foursome "Tiger Bonesaw", with front man and guitarist Dennis Hadrika, impressed the crowd with their latest, previously unplayed numbers from their new CD, which is due out soon.
Spectators at the front danced to the harmonious, rhythmic sound of the band.
Despite the cries of "encore", "Tiger Bonesaw" left the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
With their alternative sounds, reminiscent of the classic rock of the 1970's, Sascha Bregenhorn on guitar, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and Kai Hölscher on the drums showed how varied hard rock can be.
After the "high energy rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" saw guitar rock with a synth.
The wistful, ballad-like "Take Me Home" was not the only multi-layered song to hit home with shifts from melodic parts to guitar-heavy rock riffs.
The foursome "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen have achieved a certain level of fame since their formation in 2005.
On Saturday, their hard rock performance was full of agility.
With their performances in front of large crowds, most recently documented in a film by Max Meis about their tour in China in 2017, "The Ignition" look and sound like they have a special kind of stage experience.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann and the rest of his band even make a unique mark on the one cover song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo, a song from the 80's.
While the sound feels more "produced" than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann walks through the audience and plays a well-received solo.
At a hard concert like this, a certain level of volume comes with the territory: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, the sound team at the "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" triple header reported the sound level to be 98 decibels.
That is equivalent to a pneumatic drill, but is lower than the levels at the Wacken Festival mentioned by "The Ignition" on their website.
The Ahlen audience had no need for the ear-piercing 120 decibels, equivalent to the sound of a jet engine, as is common at the northern metal show.
The three hard rock bands delighted the crowd with their masterful, virtuoso performances and their self-written compositions.
At the end, all three groups could, figuratively speaking, say "here we will stand, with bone saws, to ignite the night with the power of a tiger".
And, most of all, they could enjoy the applause of the crowd.

One dead in glider accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A glider crashed on a Mülheim/Essen airport car park on Sunday.
The pilot lost his life in the accident.
Mülheim/Essen was the scene of a fatal accident on Sunday.
As reported by "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a glider crashed on the exhibition car park.
The pilot died as a result.
"WAZ" also reports that the trainee pilot was the only person on board - the glider is reported to have been a single seater.
The aircraft was approaching to land when the accident occurred.
The glider crashed close to a marquee in the airport.
An Oktoberfest celebration has been held since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen airport is on the outskirts of both Ruhr towns and is on the access road to Autobahn 52.
The car park offers a park & ride connection to major events in the Essen trade hall or Gruga Hall.
Trump woos Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It's no secret that despite the nuclear crisis, the US president is sympathetic towards North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
However, Trump has made a declaration of love for his counterpart.
It centers around Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has met a new love.
The tragic part - it's a long-distance relationship.
In full view of the public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the state of West Virginia, Trump had tender words for the scion of the Kim dynasty from Pyongyang, who is half his age, even though the latter has proven himself to be a tough nut to crack in the talks over North Korean denuclearization.
"I was being really tough, so was he, and we went back and forth", said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Alright?
No, really.
And it was not just the conversations with Kim that melted Trump's heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also bore political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announcement of all nuclear bomb and rocket tests, even though critics have regarded this as little more than lip service so far.
The US President appeared to acknowledge that his affection for "Rocket Man" - as Trump calls him - who is notorious for his threatening military gestures, would not sit well with everyone.
In any case, Trump pre-empted the expected criticism of this announcement in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How horrible, how horrible is that?
That is so unpresidential.
However, Trump said that he did not care at all, and pointed his finger at the crowd: "I have always told you - it is so easy to be presidential".
But then instead of having ten thousand people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we would have about two hundred people standing outside.
Oktoberfest brings many visitors to Baesweiler
Baesweiler - Popular with visitors, full of atmosphere and drenched in sunshine: the heart of Baesweiler showcased a wide-ranging array of festivities with a hearty dose of Oktoberfest flair.

Refugees saved from Libyan jail thanks to video
A group of Nigerian refugees have secured their rescue after highlighting their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya with a smartphone video.
With their lives in danger, the group took the footage in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and shared it online.
"They are refusing to send us back", said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The footage was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we would probably not been able to make it back to Nigeria", said Efe Onyeka, the man who took the video, to the AFP news agency.
The 25 year-old was detained in Libya trying to make his way to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea.
He claims that by taking the video footage, he put his life in danger.
One of his companions was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general terms, the prison conditions were terrible: "They hit us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat and we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organizing the voluntary repatriation of refugees who are stranded in Libya.
The program has helped return around 2,700 Nigerian migrants to their homeland, according to the IOM spokesman in Nigeria, Jorge Galindo.
When it comes to bad prison conditions, the case of the rescued Nigerians is not uncommon.
However, until this case, he had not heard of an appeal for help via smartphone.
International organizations have long criticized conditions in Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, large parts of which are controlled by militias, is the main transit country for migrants coming from Africa to Europe.

German man stuck in car for days
A 75 year-old man had to endure several days and nights in his car in a wooded area of Middle Franconia after getting stuck off-road far from the forest pathways and a tree blocked his exit from the vehicle.
Police reported on Sunday that rescue services chanced upon the vehicle near a meadow on Saturday afternoon and freed the man who had been missing since Tuesday.
According to reports, despite the cold nights and days without food and drink, the 75 year-old man from Pleinfeld was in a good physical condition.
He said he was looking forward to returning home.
The pensioner was reported missing by his family after he failed to return from a journey across the local fields and meadows in his all-terrain vehicle on Tuesday.
Despite intensive searches, the whereabouts of the man were unknown for days.
Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
Cologne - according to reports, NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called on Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan to uphold the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are said to be "under a cloud", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
The main topics of the meeting were waves of arrests, freedom of the press and religious freedoms.
He is reported to have made it clear to Erdogan that "the rule of law is a key prerequisite for the normalization of relations in the future and the strengthening of economic ties".
Some sources claimed that Laschet mentioned the cases of Germans who are currently in Turkish prisons.
He made it clear that freedom of speech must be upheld.
In response, Erdogan again emphasized the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The meeting between Laschet and Erdogan was arranged at short notice in a Federal Ministry of Defence air transport building in Cologne airport.
It was originally scheduled to take place at Castle Wahn, however, the owners of the castle refused permission, in protest at Erdogan's policies.
After the meeting, Erdogan then went to open the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet canceled an appearance together in the building.
However, he stated that "Muslims who attend this mosque are also German citizens".
And we are the ones they should engage with, not the Turkish president.
Lack of trust in the USA: North Korea makes denuclearization demand
While US president Donald Trump does not tire of extolling the successes of his negotiations over the denuclearization of North Korea, the east Asian regime presents a much more sober reality.
Foreign minister Ri demands concession from Washington.
In the UN general debate, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of hampering negotiations on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
"The latest impasse is a result of the US resorting to coercive measures which destroy any attempts to build trust", said Ri in New York.
Denuclearization is inconceivable for North Korea under such conditions.
"Without any trust in the USA ,we cannot have any trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm" declared the chief North Korean diplomat.
He called the notion that North Korea could be brought to its knees by such ideas "a fantasy among people who do not know who they are dealing with".
Ri claimed that his country had brought nuclear weapon and missile testing to a halt and destroyed an atomic testing facility to build trust.
However, the minister criticized the fact that the US had made no "corresponding gestures".
North Korea's nuclear weapon and missile program has resulted in the UN Security Council announcing three rounds of sanctions against the internationally isolated state in the past year alone.
IN recent days, US president Donald Trump and his foreign minister Mike Pompeo have insisted on strict observance of the punitive measures at the UN.
At the same time, the US is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, Trump has aimed towards a second summit meeting with Kim.
Pompeo is scheduled to travel once again to Pyongyang in October for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT is serving: New kitchen possible with the community's donations
Because it took place in a youth center, many visitors did not visit HoT's open house: white tablecloth and bouquets of flowers were waiting for the guests after the church service in Erntedank.
As if conjuring magic tricks in the new kitchen, the HoT's youth prepared the buffet with specialties from various countries.
The meal was intended as thanks from the youth to the organization, which is financed by the community's donations.
The beginning of the new organization was not easy, as remembered by HoT's leader Henriette Westbuer.
Our refrigerators were bulging with meals and additional ingredients already before the summer break, and we were well prepared for the big day.
Then on the first day after the summer break, the worst surprise: A power outage knocked the huge two-section refrigerator out of commission. The food had spoiled and needed to be disposed of.
"At that point, we had to start from the beginning: Indeed we received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to take care of the situation on their own," said Westbuer.
Then everyone pitched in.
The result was self evident, as the guests were impressed.
"A professional cook could not have managed it better," praised a clearly impressed visitor, while her Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served. Or perhaps it was while she was being served the quiche, a Leberkäse (Bavarian meatloaf) or even a piece of cake.
"It is truly wonderful what the youth were able to get off the ground," said pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen astounded guests with his card tricks and other feats.
Jürgen Sator leaves NRW food bank regional board
Frustrated by criticism from within his own ranks, Jörg Sartor has resigned his position as head of Essen's regional food bank board.
Sartor became known across Germany when the Essen food bank stopped accepting foreigners.
Sartor told  "Welt am Sonntag" that he had already stepped down as vice head of NRW food banks in July.
Too many people double-crossed me.
The head of the NRW regional food bank association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, told dpa that he understood the decision of his long-time deputy.
The fierce criticism wore Sartor down.
"I can understand his decision - people have come out and said things without knowing why the Essen food bank have taken this decision". 
Sartor is, however, set to play a continuing role at the Essen food bank - "six days a week - no change there", said Weilerswist.
In the "Welt am Sonntag", Sartor criticized colleagues from other food banks who had criticized him.
He felt the statement that "without us, people in the town will starve", was inappropriate.
It is a responsibility of the state to prevent people from starving.
The Essen man played no part in a food bank congress in Berlin on Friday.
"People will tell me too much sweet nonsense there", he said.
You have these loony lefties there who gave me so much flak.
SF Lorch blow 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Regional League - Lorch lose 3-2 to Neuler - TV Heuchlingen win in Kirchheim after falling behind - Bettringen thump Lauchheim.
Lorch were 2-0 up at home against TV Neuler - it finished 3-2 to Neuler, to the great disappointment of the home fans.

Gladbach blow two leads - Schalke get first win without Embolo
Borussia Mönchengladbach's wait for a win at Wolfsburg goes on.
Foals let two leads slip in 2-2 draw.
Schalke get first win of the season against Mainz (1-0).
(sda) In their first five league games, Schalke fell behind to early goals.
This time, Domenico Tedesco's team showed the kind of form that saw them come second behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf headed the home side into the lead after good work by Yevhen Konoplyanka, the hosts then defended their slender lead with a disciplined defensive performance.
Borussia Dortmund are top of the Bundesliga again after an incredible comeback.
Lucien Favre's team were 2-0 down to Bayer Leverkusen at half-time, but ended up winning 4-2.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th minute) and Marco Reus (69th minute) scored two in four minutes to level, Paco Alcacer, brought on by Favre in the 63rd minute, rounded off the second-half transformation in the final stages (86th and 94th minutes).
VfB Stuttgart also got their first win.
Stuttgart had to endure intermittent periods of nerves against Werder Bremen, who were reduced to ten men in the first half when Milos Veljkovic was sent off.
Borna Sosa and careless goalie Ron-Robert Zieler somehow contrived to turn a throw-in into an own goal, gifting the away side an equalizer in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro gave VfB their first win.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang's Borussia Mönchengladbach debut may not have been perfect, but it was not the worst debut ever.
The Gladbach team, with Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, let two leads slip to draw 2-2 and are still seeking their first win in the home town of the Volkswagen since 2003.
Renato Steffen's second league goal of the season brought Wolfsburg level.
Yann Sommer was powerless to stop the Aargau native's low shot from 20 yards, just as he had no chance with the second equalizer after an hour.
However, Gladbach are showing very promising signs.
Up front, Alassane Pléa is proving to be a real goal-getter for the Foals.
The Frenchman, a record signing from OGC Nice, scored for the third game in a row, getting his seventh goal in seven as many competitive games in the process.
After seven games, Gladbach are in fourth.
Within 40 minutes, Werder Bremen, who were previously unbeaten, contrived to put themselves in a tricky predicament against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's side were taken surprise by a Stuttgart counter-attack, which ex-Lugano player Anastasios Donis rounded off with his first goal of the season, and after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic made things even worse for his team: the 23 year-old Serb got his second yellow card for pulling Daniel Didavi's shirt.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and keeper Ron-Robert Zieler put Werder back in the game with a bizarre own goal, Gonzalo Castro put Stuttgart, with the man advantage, back into the lead with just a quarter of an hour to play.
Nuremberg enjoyed an emphatic 3-0 win against Düsseldorf.
Hanno Behrens set the home side on their way with a penalty after half an hour of play.
Macedonians vote on new official name
Around 1.8 million Macedonians are going to the polls today to vote on a proposed change of their country's name to North Macedonia.
A "Yes" vote could resolve a dispute with neighboring country Greece which has lasted for nearly three decades.
Athens has insisted on a name change due to the fact it has a province of the same name and has obstructed every attempt by Macedonia to pursue Westernization.
For this reason, voters are also deciding on the future westward integration of the country.
US officials have suggested that, if the referendum goes the right way, the country could quickly become a member of NATO.
Syrian in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian beat up three pensioners and left them with serious injuries.
The 41 year-old asylum seeker struck at about 10pm on Friday in Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
As police officers arrived at the scene, they spoke to the accused, who went after passers-by with clenched fists attempting to attack them, about his behavior.
The Syrian then attempted to punch and kick the officers.
Shortly afterwards, it came to light that the suspect had just beaten three old women (aged 65, 67 and 75) to the ground with his fists right by a tram stop in Währinger Straße.
He also kicked the women.
Some of the injuries the pensioners suffered were serious.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker, according to the police, also suffered "serious injuries of unknown cause".
He was taken to hospital and kept under permanent watch while under treatment.
SPD politics: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Almost one year after equal marriage came into effect, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-term partner Christoph Rohde.
The pair tied the knot in Hamburg on Saturday.
Kahrs had previously told Bild that a civil partnership was out of the question.
"If we are going to get married, we're doing it properly". He has been with his partner for 25 years.
55 year-old Kahrs is the SPD Bundestag spokesman for budgetary affairs and one of the spokespeople for the Seeheimer Kreis, a group on the conservative wing of the SPD.
In the Bundestag debate on the legalization of gay marriage, Kahrs grabbed attention with an angry speech on 30th June 2017.
He accused Chancellor Merkel (CDU) of "bungling" the issue.
"That was her Schabowski moment", he said in reference to the inadvertent announcement of the opening of the East German border by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have enjoyed the same marriage rights as heterosexuals.
Same-sex couples have had the right to enter into civil partnerships since 2001, however, until now they had inferior rights compared to heterosexual couples, for instance with regard to adoption.
Garden Day: 400 Meter Hedge Trimmed
It was a lot of work for the members of the Kinderhaus Civic Association and the Leprosy Society.
Whis is why the 400 meter hedge that circles the garden of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus has to be trimmed.
Over twelve workers helped support the residents in their task.
"We are doing this to lower the costs," explained the head of the civic association Walter Schröer.
And exactly that is what they managed to do.
Due to the hot summer, we are late this year. Luckily it is now just a matter of shaping.
The hedge had already been trimmed earlier in the year.
It has been a long tradition that afterwards the workers are served a breakfast.
"They should keep up their strength," said Walter Schröer.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold in canoe slalom world championship
Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal in the finale of the canoe slalom world championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29 year-old had a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed out on an Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
"I was well prepared, I have had enough runs here and it all worked out today", said the London 2012 bronze medalist.
He threw his paddle with joy at the finishing line and, confident of victory, threw both arms in the air - safe in the knowledge that his efforts would secure him a medal.
He was fourth on the starting list.
But the six remaining starters could not beat his time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec came second, ahead of Russian Pavel Eigel.
Gauting police are reporting this autumn's first break-in attempt at a detached house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators were unsuccessful.
The days are getting shorter - something burglars want to use to their advantage once again.
This is from Gauting police's report from yesterday, on this autumn's first break-in attempt.
The fact that nothing was stolen from the detached house on Königswieser Straße is thanks to the alarm system.
It went off when the burglars made their attempt just before 8pm.
The intruders had suspected that the house was empty.
However, they were so surprised by the alarm that they fled the scene without any loot.
Anyone with information should call Gauting police department on (089) 8 93 13 30.
Collapse against Hertha: brought down to earth: calls for reaction against Ajax
The "invincibles" tag has gone: Bayern "don't want to just lie down" the defeat in Berlin.
The coming clashes against Ajax and Gladbach will serve as an interim evaluation of the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The Munich side cannot afford to let the first minor blip under new manager Niko Kovac become a bigger autumn slump.
"A week ago, people thought we were unbeatable.
We have been brought back down to earth a bit", said Thomas Müller after the deserved 2-0 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction in the Champions League game against Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us knows that we will be angry and will come out fighting on Tuesday.
It was the first away game in over a year in which they failed to score, and their second consecutive game without a win, as at the same point as last season, meant they lost top spot in the Bundesliga to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is however nowhere near as grave as the ill-fated reign of Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but Germany's most-successful club have to react.
FC Augsburg's intensive man-marking in a 1:1 and Hertha's theatrical gamesmanship have both provided blueprints on how Bayern, seemingly invincible beforehand, can be thwarted.
"Whoever knows Bayern knows that we will not back down and will do everything to get back to winning ways", Kovac emphasized.
He was otherwise surprisingly gentle in his comments on his side in the city of his birth and put his first defeat as Bayern manager down to his side once again failing to take their chances.
However, wins against Ajax and then against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday before the international break would make the overall assessment of his initial reign a positive one - otherwise, the mood will only darken.
Kovac has made no major changes for the second European tie after Bayern's 2:0 win against Benfica.
After a rest day on Sunday, the brief preparations will begin as normal for the second group game against Ajax, who outclassed AEK Athens in their first game with a 3-0 win.
"We have drawn blanks in two games now, but we will soon be scoring goals again", said national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Joshua Kimmich put things simply, just as he did after the Super Cup Final defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt.
The right-back warned his teammates.
"I don't think it is all doom and gloom, we have to fight for everything because we are missing most of our chances and we are making mistakes at the back", said the 23 year-old shortly before the team departed the Olympiastadion.
Last season, Bayern were five points behind Dortmund, who have now overtaken them to go top by one point, after just seven games.
And so Kimmich, with a twinkle in his eye was positive about the public debate about Bayern being unbeatable coming to an end.
"Yes, it is a good thing", said the German international.
It's a good thing for the Bundesliga.
DFB chief in the firing line: Özil saga: Erdogan strongly criticizes Grindel.
The Turkish president fiercely condemns the marginalization of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
Although DFB President Grindel recognizes mistakes, he is defending the governing body line.
A new post is set to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel used different platforms to wage a war of words in the long-running Mesut Özil saga.
The head of the DFB defended the governing body line after the Turkish president, speaking at the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne, fiercely criticized the way the World Cup-winner has been treated.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, who has been fiercely criticized by Özil, talked about the next steps following the saga in the Mainz ZDF-"Sportstudio".
"In future, it is imperative that we draw accurate conclusions to avoid a repeat of what has happened as we also have players with a migrant background in the youth teams", said the 57 year old, who wants to recruit a player of non-migrant background as an integration ambassador.
Grindel also repeated his claim that Erdogan does not represent the values of football or the DFB.
Erdogan has fiercely denounced the treatment suffered by Özil and Ilkay Gündogan as racism.
Our Mesut and our Ilkay - German born and bred.
They have been marginalized from German society because they had their picture taken with me in England", said Erdogan in Cologne on Saturday.
To be honest, as President, I could not stomach the fact that our two young men, who have reached the heights of the German national team, have been sidelined.
Grindel made reference to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he felt he "had been treated fairly" after the World Cup fiasco, which started with the pair being photographed with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would speak to players face-to-face in future.
When someone says "When I win, i am German, when I lose, I'm a migrant" - that is wrong.
"I deeply regret the fact that he feels this way", Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I have always said that.
However, he sees no reason for Özil to return to the national side.
As a result, an additional integration ambassador is to be appointed alongside the Brazil-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who originates from Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background with a big profile in society and football said "this is an important issue, we have to look into this", it would also be something which would provide a better basis for our associations on the ground, where integration has to work", said Grindel.
Despite being criticized after Germany's elimination from the World Cup and the Özil saga, he wishes to stand as a candidate for the DFB presidency next year.
"I am doing my job and am trying to do it as well as it can be done", said Grindel.
Pensioner causes three accidents in three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to police reports, a 75 year-old man caused three accidents between 10am and 1pm on Friday.
At first, the 75 year-old driver was spoken to by a woman at a red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told him his car had gone into hers.
However, no personal data was exchanged as the man was unable to find the woman again in the car park.
Shortly afterwards, police received a telephone report of a motorist who had gone off the road and into a reflector post.
When he was spoken to about this, the man wanted no police involvement and drove off.
The Rödental resident then went home.
However, the pensioner got lost in the town he has lived in for decades and when turning rammed into a construction vehicle.
The police were finally able to find and apprehend the man.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75 year old appeared confused and could not remember much.
About 1,300 euros worth of damage was caused.
Underground peat fire in Meppen: 1,000 firefighters still deployed.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the underground peat fire on Bundeswehr property in Emsland, 980 firefighters are still tackling the blaze.
This was reported by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
A spokesperson said that since the situation has stabilized further, 70 voluntary assistants have been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of deployed personnel is reportedly planned.
In the early hours of Sunday morning, an overground fire was detected and extinguished.
Last week, the status of emergency situation, which had been announced a good week before on September 21 due to the fear of the flames spreading to surrounding forests and settlements via wind and sparks, was lifted.
On Thursday, it was a matter of preventing the blaze form spreading to neighboring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 people were on the scene trying to bring the blaze under control.
The German air force have provided transport helicopter support on the German army testing site by Meppen.
German army drones have also been used for recon flights.
According to the German army, further recon flights with "Tornados" are planned for October 2nd and October 5th.
The fire was caused by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The trail of smoke from the peat fire stretched up to one hundred kilometers in width across the north-west of Germany, reaching as far as Bremen.
On Monday, the German army plans to establish a point of contact for the receipt of damage reports.
The first compensation claims have already been made by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, pictured right) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the St. Katharinen Church in Hamburg after their wedding.
The politician married his long-term boyfriend in Hamburg almost one year after marriage equality came into force.
The couple have been together for 25 years.
Hamburg - SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-term partner Christoph Rohde almost one year after marriage equality came into law.
The couple tied the knot on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told "Bild" that a civil partnership was out of the question.
If we are getting married, then we are doing it properly.
The pair have been together for 25 years.
The 55 year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman in the Bundestag for the SPD and is one of the spokespeople for the Seeheimer Group, on the conservative wing of the SPD.
Kahrs grabbed attention in the Bundestag debate on marriage equality on 30 June 2017 with a raging polemic.
He accused Chancellor Merkel (CDU) of having "bungled" the issue.
"This was her Schabowski moment", he said, in reference to the inadvertent declaration of the opening of the East German border by Günter Schabowski.
Same-sex couples have been able to marry since 1 October 2017.
Previously, they had been able to register civil partnerships from 2001, but they did not enjoy equal marriage or adoption rights.
Macedonia - referendum on new country name underway 
Macedonia's long-awaited referendum on a new official state name for the small Balkan country has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are heading to the polls to decide whether to change the name of the country to Northern Macedonia.
Neighboring Greece, due to its northern province of the same name, has insisted on such a change.
In an attempt to force Skopje's hand, Athens has blocked any attempts by Macedonia to bring itself closer to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
Should voters approve the change, it will give the go-ahead for the country's Western integration.
Elie Wiesel - the author who salvaged the memory of the Holocaust
On September 30th, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner died in the USA in 2016, leaving behind a work which preserves the horror of the Holocaust for posterity.
Switzerland opens electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to make organ donations easier and relieve relatives in times of stress.
Swisstransplant has stressed that the new procedure does not change the fact that organs may still only be removed with explicit consent.
(dpa) This Monday, Switzerland will open an electronic register for organ donors.
It is is intended to make organ donations easier and relieve relatives in times of stress.
Those who wish to make their organs available for donation after their death can sign up to the register.
Swisstransplant can then retrieve their details in case of need.
Swisstransplant has stressed that the new procedure does not change the fact that - as in Germany - organs may still only be removed with explicit consent.
It is estimated that 15% of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of Swisstransplant.
But it has been found that the number of potential donors whose donor card can be found when the time comes to donate organs is just 5 per cent.
In over 60 per cent of cases, relatives are not aware of the wishes of the deceased.
"They then have to make a decision on behalf of the deceased, which is often very difficult to bear, said Immer.
There is already a similar registration system in Great Britain.
In Germany, Marita Völker-Albert, spokeswoman for the Federal Center of Health Education, says that plans to store organ donation details on health insurance cards are under consideration.
"There is no register where people can enter their intentions for or against organ donations", she said.
Health minister Jens Spahn has declared his support for organ donation reform.
Under his proposal, every individual would be considered a potential organ donor unless they or their relatives object.
The Catholic Church is opposed to this, as are other groups.
14 year-old schoolboy becomes mental arithmetic world champion
14 year-old Tomohiro Iseda from Japan has become the world champion in mental arithmetic.
He came out on top against 39 opponents in Wolfsburg at the weekend.
His victory was announced on Sunday by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, where the competition was held.
16 year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took 3rd place.
According to chief judge Ralf Laue, the youngest world championship participant was a 12 year-old boy from Japan, the oldest being a 74 year-old pensioner from France.
The IT professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Examples of problems include: 14,130,214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since no spectators was allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon during which participants went up against members of the public armed with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß, from Lastrup, showed how he can keep a ball in the air with his head while solving mental arithmetic problems.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to enter the competition.
Two years ago, Grüß participated in Bielefeld, when he was 14.
Words like "mastermind", "genius" or "wunderkind" mean little to organizer Laue.
"Arithmetic can be learned", he said.
Many participants had practiced for several hours each day.
In India and Singapore, there are even calculation competitions held in stadiums.
One of the disciplines is calculating square roots of six-digit numbers.
In multi-tasking exercises, the candidates are given surprising problems for which they quickly have to find a solution.
The main judge said that the Germans had a good chance here.
Otherwise, it is Asians who have an advantage, as they are taught mental arithmetic at an earlier age and with other, more effective methods.
An urgent appeal: video featuring a naked Serena Williams - about detecting cancer early
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows her emotional, sensitive side.
The 37 year-old aims to raise breast cancer awareness in this video and encourage early detection.
It's a matter of life and death, but also courage and raising awareness.
A topless Serena Williams sings "I Touch Myself" by "The Divinyls" - with only her hands covering her most intimate parts.
The Divinyls' frontwoman, Chrissy Amphlett, died of breast cancer.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which centers around early breast cancer detection, which can save lives.
Serena Williams almost died a year ago.
There were complications when her daughter Alexis Olympia was born.
Surgeons performed an emergency operation to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT scan showed blood clots in Serena's lungs.
Just in the nick of time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The government is planning a significant extension of the prohibition on the use of extremist symbols
In the coming week, the turquoise-blue coalition will issue draft legislation on the so-called "Symbols Law" for review.
The bill intends to extend the range of terrorist groups and similar groups which the prohibition will cover.
Polar cold winds to bring new snowfall to mountains in the West
Old Mother Frost is set to make her bed for the first time in the coming weeks: polar cold winds are set to hit Vorarlberg, Northern Tyrols and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit is set to drop from 1,5000 meters to 1,200 meters at the start of the week, with more intense snowfall potentially reaching as low as 1,000 meters in narrow valleys.
Between 20 to 40 centimeters of snow are set to fall at altitudes above 2,000 meters from the Bregenz Forest to the Upper Tauern.
Winter conditions are expected on higher passes (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlos Pass, Felbertauern, Großglockner High Alpine Way).
Farmers may begin annual branch clear-up on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein farmers may begin the annual branch clear-up on Monday.
The "green walls" ,which are unique in Germany, have been part of the landscape of the sparsely wooded federal state for around 200 years.
The tree and thicket hedges, which are up to five meters wide, are a "forest replacement" and the last place of refuge for many animals and plants.
Branches bind living spaces, which are spread like passageways, along with the movement of organisms can still function,as stated by Ingo Ludwichowski, the local head of Germany's natural conservation agency, (NABU).
Branches form living fences
The branches were first used in this way in 1766, by order of the Danish king Christian VI, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not just field dividers and cattle fencing, they supplied farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered buildings.
The name for the branches, known locally as "Knicks", also originates from this time: the thick, interwoven boundaries came from the word "umknicken", the breaking of tree branches.
Today, around 45,000 meters of hedge stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic, providing a landscape which is rich in wood and varied in structure.
According to NABU, they are used as a habitat by around 7000 animal species.
One kilometer of hedge could be home to as much as 1800 different species and up to 30 breeding pairs of birds.
However, the hedge can only perform its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, it atrophies and becomes a sparse row of trees, which has a detrimental effect on species variety and its wind protection, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the hedges may only be tended to outside the breeding season of October to March.
After the tsunami on Sulawesi, an Indonesian man reports on the situation on the ground
Local man Radika Pinto describes the situation on the ground on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami in an interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND):
Were you on Sulawesi when the earthquake struck?
No, at the time I was in Jakarta, on Java.
When the earthquake struck, my wife range me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately headed back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday because I had to drive 20 hours by car after my flight, because Palu airport was closed at the time.
What is the situation like on the island now?
The national government reopened the airport to allow aid to be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast which had been completely destroyed.
Even our "World Vision" office is destroyed, but we have set up a temporary refuge where we have accommodated people.
Where are the people who live on Sulawesi right now?
Many ran to the surrounding hills, where they are staying out of fear of another earthquake or tsunami and where they have no access to water or food.
Some are still in front of their houses; there are still aftershocks.
Because many food shops and petrol stations are closed, some people have taken to stealing food and petrol.
Public services are completely shut down - the national government is providing assistance.
A prison was damaged, some of the prisoners are now roaming the streets and finding them is difficult.
There are lots of corpses lying around, lots of people have not been found and many are still missing.
What are things like for communication and spreading information?
Right now we have mobile reception, but even that was down initially and we only got information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, not knowing whether they are alive or dead, because many people were not at home when the earthquake struck; they were on their way to work, for example. 
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We do not know the reason why it did not work, but when we got the all-clear, we thought "okay, no tsunami" and then there was a tsunami.
Other regions not affected by the tsunami were given the incorrect information that a tsunami was approaching and people ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island such as Sulawesi, which lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, really not prepared for earthquakes?
Of course, there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
Normally we are able to react to earthquakes and hold evacuation drills.
But our entire infrastructure collapsed, the earthquake has affected many people.
Muscle Injuries Against Werder: VfB have long had to do without Aogo and Donis
VfB Stuttgart will have to manage without the services of Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo for a longer time.
Aogo was injured with a torn hamstring in his left thigh during a 2-1 victory against Werder Bremen on Saturday the top league team announced the following day.
The doctors diagnosed a torn thigh muscle for Doni.
Both players will definitely be unavailable to play the game against Hannover 96 on Saturday, and they will even likely miss more games after the international break.
VfB Stuttgart could not predict when they would return.
A torn muscle usually takes between six to eight weeks to heal, while a torn hamstring usually heals more quickly.
Victory for hyperrealism at San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - Every year, the San Sebastián Film Festival draws the curtain on Europe's elite film festival calendar.
And though some may proclaim the decline of cinema, it can be said that 2018 was a remarkable year in film.
After an impressive Cannes festival, with strong contributions from Europe and Asia, and a Venice Film Festival which attracted much attention with Oscar nominees from Hollywood, this year's festival in San Sebastian was one of the best it has produced in recent years.
Olching fire department tried to rescue an injured duck on Sunday morning.
However, this took some time.
They even used a boat.
Olching - walkers on Lake Olching spotted an injured white duck on Sunday morning.
It was in the area of the water watch station.
Passers-by called the police and fire departments to help the animal.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck failed.
In spite of its injury, it kept evading rescue services.
It eventually fled to the lake.
The fire department closed in on the duck and forced it back onto land where, after almost an hour, it was then put into a transport box by a fireman with a spirited grip.
The duck, which had a chest injury, was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
However, early assessments indicate its chances of survival are rather small.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aiming for World Championship medal
Julian Eberhard's fourth-place Olympic finish still sticks in his stomach.
The Saalfeld athlete wants to make up for missing out on a medal at the World Championship in Östersund this winter.
In the Olympic sprint in Pyeongchang, the 31 year-old's final shot cost him a medal which was in his grasp.
He missed out on a bronze by seven tenths of a second.
"I have deliberately dedicated time towards it", said Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
My aim was to get a medal, I was in top form, but it was not to be.
This season, the Pinzgau man is now even more determined to get the medal he missed out on: "The only aim I can have is to turn this into something positive, to win something.
After all, every dog has its day eventually.
The World Championship cross-country ski slope in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard's focus: "I have taken the route to heart", he happily reminisces on his fourth-placed World Cup finish in the solo sprints last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated Austria's sole victory in the mass start at the previous World Cup winter in Kontiolahti (FIN).
He was second in the relay in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: turbo-speed FBI investigation
Time is running out and the number of planned hearings is extremely limited.
In the United States, Senate Republicans intend to use an FBI investigation to safeguard their wafer-thin majority for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing allegations of sexual assault.
President Donald Trump has given investigators until Friday to look into the allegations which date from more than 30 years ago.
The latest twist in the appointment of Kavanaugh, which has become a subject of the culture war, took place on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing involving Kavanaugh and initial accuser Christine Blasey Ford, during which the judge flew into raging tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Justice Committee was set to clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge to the highest court in the land.
It appeared that most Republicans were on board until, suddenly, senator Jeff Flake, contradicting his initial statement, said that he would support Kavanaugh's appointment but demanded an FBI investigation.
After uproarious scenes, his fellow party members agreed.
President Trump, who described the serious allegations as a "swindle", refrained from making further attacks on the women and spoke, in contrast, of a "blessing in disguise".
The investigation was a way of removing any remaining doubts, he claimed.
Later, at a rally, Trump fiercely criticized Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to obstruct and disrupt things".
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has severely restricted the scope of what investigators can do.
A government spokesperson told the "Wall Street Journal" that the known accusations of two women will be investigated, and no others: "They are not going on a fishing expedition". 
According to the "New York Times", only four witnesses will be interviewed.
According to Ried municipal authority, the mobile radar device for monitoring road speeds which it has installed in an "unmarked vehicle" will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1st.
This also happens to be the location of the federal school center.
The municipal authority is also operating several radar boxes in fixed locations.
FC Schalke 04 after win against Mainz: you could feel the nerves
Manager Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 clinched their first win of the season against Mainz.
A huge relief for Schalke after their first win of the campaign.
However, the time factor was against Mainz in this match.
Gelsenkirchen - By now, it is a well known fact that Christian Heidel is a great pessimist when it comes to football matches.
The home match against Mainz 05 was nothing different.
"I always thought the ball was going in.
And there were a lot of corners and balls into our box", said the sporting director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
But the Royal Blues eventually managed to play out a slender 1-0 win against the Rhinehessen side, securing their first win of the season.
But the result could have been very different.
After Alessandro Schöpf's goal in the 11th minute boosted the confidence of Tedesco's side - "Overall, we had a good first half, both in possession and in the press", he commented - heads played a greater role as the game went on.
Schöpf not really good in the air
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me", said Heidel: "I can understand if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench".
The team were wary of surrendering yet another lead and went deeper and deeper as a result.
And they defended as if their lives depended on it against Mainz.
All to secure the first three points of the campaign.
"A great weight has fallen from our shoulders", said Schöpf, who played a key part with his headed goal: "I am actually the worst header of a ball in the side".
But, in the end, it is the win that counts.
The sense of relief was palpable in the entire stadium, not least with Tedesco.
"We wanted to apply pressure right from the off and make things happen", said the Schalke manager.
It was an important win.
We could finally celebrate for a few hours.
I am really, really happy for the team and the fans.
We were intelligent, calm and positive in our play - this is how we should approach games across the 90 minutes
Perhaps the most negative aspect was that Schalke failed to win by a more comfortable margin.
They certainly had the opportunities, such as through the impressive Yevhen Konoplyanka, who hit the bar twice on 59 and 72 minutes, and Amine Harit on 62 minutes.
"It would not have been a nervy win then", said Tedesco: "You could certainly feel the tension a little bit".
So I am pleased that we won.
He wasn't the only one.
Fischbachau: smoke pillar visible for 2 km in Leitzachtal
You could not miss the smoke.
A hiker in Leitzachtal spotted a fire about 2 km away at about 1:30pm on Sunday.
Police are now investigating.
Fischbachau - the police and fire departments soon discovered the cause: an unidentified individual set fire to some trash on an area of about two square meters on Gschwender Mountain.
According to police, it appears the individual watched over the fire for a long time but left the embers unattended.
Right by a forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters managed and extinguished the fire.
Police are now treating the incident as arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a conversation at eye level
The author, sociology professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani is standing in front of you.
He has been here multiple times after repeated invitations from Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"For many years, I have made it a point to bring interesting people to Greven," explained the founder and chair of the "Reckenfelder Meetings" - the association that worked in cooperation to make cultural policy the focus of the evening.
El-Mafaalani conducted the reading in a relaxed manner, described the book's writing process and spoke about how difficult it was to explain this topic in a way that it could be understood.
With excited gesturing and concrete facts and figures, as well as a little humor here and there, he made a potentially controversial subject more understandable: migration and integration.
Despite successful integration, why is increasing conflict arising?
The Syrian author employs a metaphor in answering the question.
At one table sits a German group, while the first generation of immigrants are at a small side table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the main table.
The third generation of immigrants were born in Germany and have always sat at the main table. Now they want a say in how things are done.
This leads to conflicts.
Whether one is oriented to the political left or the right is not the essential question. Instead, he stressed, "Am I for or against an open society?" 
At first it was rather restrained, but the round of discussion got more excited.
There was a need to talk.
An Afghan refugee shared from his perspective, and then two teachers described successful and unsuccessful integration that they had seen with students.
El-Mafaalani stayed with the others, rather than being on stage, which was symbolic for the discussion: it was held at eye level.
The sociology professor did not force his personal opinion on anyone. He spoke about a general experience rather than the fates of individuals.
The interest on the subject pleased him, because, "Only when we understand what the problem is, can we find solutions," said El-Mafaalani.
Also during the subsequent book signing, was he still eager to answer the guests' questions. People munched on prepared Kurdish delicacies, while the intense discussion continued in the foyer.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening matches 
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn won home and away respectively on the opening day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL).
Gießen won a hard-fought home game 91:84 (43:46) against Mitteldeutscher BC.
The ambitious Bonn side won 86:79 (49:47) at BG Göttingen.
Alba Berlin are the league leaders after day one after a 112:55 thrashing of Science City Jena on Saturday.
German champions Bayern Munich and previous champions Brose Bamberg had a much harder time of things in their opening games of the season.
Munich battled to a 83:77 win against ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, while Bamberg defeated s.Oliver Würzburg in the Franconian derby with a score of 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots of land
The demand seems to be huge: over 100 interested parties applied to buy the land in Landham-Süd.
Pliening municipality has sold the first plots of land in the new-build area of Landsham-Süd on the open market.
This has been announced by mayor Roland Frick.
in addition, the application phase for 20 plots of land which have been offered by the municipality at more affordable conditions and prices, similar to the previous local model, has concluded.
According to Frick, a good 100 applications have been received.
"The documents are currently under review", being assessed according to application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Pliening mayor, the aim is to have an applicant ranking list for the 20 plots of land and to present this list to the municipal council.
The plots of land can then be allocated.
In total, 50 plots of lands will be created in the area in the south of Landsham for detached and semi-detached houses, as well as four plots for multi-occupancy houses, each containing eight residential units.
The development is more or less finished, the roads and paths are to be laid imminently.
One plot of land and two of the multi-occupancy buildings belong to a private individual, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
It will sell most of them on the open market, 20 plots of land in a sustainable manner.
According to Frick, the municipality's multi-occupancy buildings are set to become affordable housing.
These will accommodate a total of 16 state-financed and income-oriented apartments.
Space for 200 people
According to rough estimates, the new estate on Landsham-Süd will house approximately 200 people.
And that's not all; now Frick claims that construction will begin on a new day care center at the start of October.
The day care center is set to accommodate three kindergarten groups, three toddler groups and a multi-purpose room.
The day care center is due to open in September 2019, in time for the start of the new kindergarten year.
Schalke's Naldo succeeds even when he's on the bench
For the third time in a row, he was not in the starting squad: nevertheless, the player thanks Schalke manager Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues was not included in Schalke's starting squad for the third time in a row and instead sat on the bench, many would have understood if the nearly two meter tall Brazilian had spoken of his deep frustration.
Instead after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mains 05, the Schalke player was in the middle of the team's celebration. While his manager was thanking the team for their effort, the 36 year old, who everyone calls Naldo, turned it around and declared, "We have you to thank, boss!"
"That was very emotional and showed great sportsmanship" insisted the manager later about his co-captain's lack of resentment regarding his new reserve status.
Celebrated as Schalke's best player last season, Naldo likely knows that his manager does not intend to get rid of the player permanently, and instead there must be a good reason for the break.
One reason, namely called "Controlling Stress".
It was not easy to inform him 
"It was not easy to inform him of my decision, that I can tell you honestly," stated Tedesco when describing the moment that Naldo would not be in the starting squad.
He is an important player and an important person.
It does not have to do with that. It always has to do with the club," insisted Tedesco when talking about the change.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
At this point, it is important that everyone can take a breath.
And that we all stay in the same ship," explained Tedesco, when describing the rotation of players that had also affected Naldo.
The wisdom of the Brazilian's maturity was shown in his reaction: by sitting on the bench, he has proven himself as a role model.
The mood of Austria's industrial sector went downhill in comparison to the Eurozone, which grew more quickly.
At 46.7 points, the ISM Manufacturing index was at a 37 month low.
Nevertheless, Austria had the third best economic atmosphere, after Ireland and the Netherlands, as was reported by the Market Institute on Monday according to a survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the Eurozone rose 1.1 points to 45.1 points on the ISM Manufacturing index, in contrast to the thirteenth successive month under 50 indicators that the growth suggests.
Alone Ireland's industrial sector rode this wave by reaching 50.9 points in August.
At the other end of the spectrum was Greece (42.1 points).
The trend indicator showed the numbers for Germany, France and Spain even dropped, but definitely more slowly than in the preceding months.
Spain reached 44 points on the index, which was the highest status since March.
"The slightly weakened decline could indeed mean that the worst is behind us," said market economist Rob Dobson.
The industrial sector continues to be the most notorious obstacle to growth, at any rate in the third quarter.
A swift return to growth is nowhere in sight: export orders in the eurozone have not dropped this much since before November 2011. 
Companies have cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Even in China, industrial output fell in August more than initially presumed.
The trend indicator fell from 49.3 points in the previous months to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The ISM Manufacturing index is based upon figures from representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial firms.
Among other factors, the measure of profit, employment, inventory and prices all contribute to the outcome of the index.
Tuchel's PSG seal 8th win in first 8 league games
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice - Thomas Tuchel wins one game after the next in Ligue 1 with Paris Saint-Germain.
The defending champions won 3-0 (HT 1-0) at OGC Nice thanks to two goals from star player Neymar and secured their eight league win in a row.
It is the best start a French side has made to a league season since Olympique Lyonnais 82 years ago.
Brazilian international Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and scored the final goal in injury time.
