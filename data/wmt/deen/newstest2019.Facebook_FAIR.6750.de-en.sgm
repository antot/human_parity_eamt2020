<seg id="2">Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This is a question that of course depends on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he obviously felt one way or the other, as stated in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmower" of the "Bild-Zeitung.</seg>
<seg id="4">Despite months of debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he said he regretted the resignation of the 92-time international Özil.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">I also assumed up to a point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 29-year-old had announced his retirement from the DFB team in July, citing the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="8">The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil for not being ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said he didn't want to build pressure, but he knows from football that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a shame that that conversation hasn't come to fruition."</seg>

<seg id="2">At 2: 13 p.m., the Linz Fire Department was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Because a high-voltage power line leads directly over the allotment, danger was in arrears.</seg>
<seg id="4">The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut on fire when they arrived.</seg>
<seg id="5">The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris had to be cleared to the extent absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the owner of the burning garden shed, he had plugged in a battery for charging at lunchtime.</seg>
<seg id="7">This could possibly be the cause of the fire.</seg>
<seg id="8">In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.</seg>
<seg id="9">The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as has the cause of the fire.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it is likely to be considerable, as the owner had many collectibles in his garden shed.</seg>

<seg id="4">Lindsay Lohan, 32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded" has herself live-streamed how she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and a partial recording of the stream is published.</seg>

<seg id="7">In the clip, Lohan is seen getting out of a car and walking to a possibly homeless family she claims to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.</seg>

<seg id="10">She provides no evidence for any of this in the clip.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The whole world is watching this," Lohan can be heard saying in the video as she continues to follow the family down the street.</seg>
<seg id="12">Apparently she is trying to separate the children from their parents.</seg>

<seg id="15">In tears, the actress then professes how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.</seg>

<seg id="1">Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment takes longer than planned</seg>
<seg id="2">"The diesel task force still exists," Chief Development Officer Peter Mertens told the industry publication "Automobilwoche."</seg>
<seg id="3">Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was arrested and placed on leave, announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be disbanded.</seg>
<seg id="4">"All engine / transmission combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018," he said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.</seg>
<seg id="7">The task force was set up in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent company Volkswagen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organisational changes" to ensure such a scandal would never happen again.</seg>
<seg id="9">The VW supervisory board postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and plans to discuss it further on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust emission values after becoming aware of the emissions cheating.</seg>
<seg id="11">In doing so, he allegedly knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently, Chief Sales Officer Bram Schot heads the company as acting CEO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Due to the changeover to the new exhaust and fuel consumption test standard WLTP, there are production losses at Audi, Schot told the "Heilbronner Stimme."</seg>
<seg id="14">In principle, he sees a decreasing demand for saloons such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The segment itself is difficult," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schot focuses on electric mobility.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join DFB executive committee</seg>
<seg id="2">Mainz (AP) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for president of the German Football Association (DFB) again next year, despite criticism of him following the World Cup exit and the Özil affair.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest on ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">You have to keep trying to get re-elected, and I will do that.</seg>
<seg id="5">And then you have to see if the support is there.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FA chief executive said it would be 'strange' if he did not 'feel like working on the project for the future' following the bid for Euro 2024.</seg>
<seg id="7">Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016, succeeding Wolfgang Niersbach, who was ousted over the summer fairy tale affair.</seg>
<seg id="8">In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.</seg>
<seg id="9">The next vote is due at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Grindel, the future head organiser of the European Championships, Philipp Lahm, is to work on the DFB executive committee.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau would agree that he should continue to advise in this role in the Bureau and then, of course, be cordially invited to make his experience available in sporting matters," Grindel said.</seg>
<seg id="12">He did not want to take part in speculation as to whether Lahm could be his successor as DFB boss.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future an international without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, this position is held by Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter with family roots in Cameroon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," the issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," Grindel said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Musicians including Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of a crowd of about 60,000.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringe and a gold microphone.</seg>
<seg id="6">I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay because I'm here and ready to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="7">Actors including Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, also took to the stage for the several-hour spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="8">In between, however, there was a moment of terror, when many spectators mistook the sound of a falling metal barrier for shots, became frightened and tried to flee.</seg>
<seg id="9">Briefly there was panic, people were running around in confusion.</seg>
<seg id="10">Seven spectators were slightly injured in the incident, organiser Hugh Evans said.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed people down from the stage.</seg>
<seg id="12">"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.</seg>

<seg id="15">If you wanted to get one, you had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="16">There were cheers and applause from the audience for the numerous musicians and actors - but boos for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.</seg>
<seg id="17">He did, however, join fellow Democrat Chris Coons on stage to speak out for more equality between men and women.</seg>
<seg id="18">But on Friday, Flake spoke out in favor of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as a Supreme Court justice in the US Senate Judiciary Committee, alienating many women.</seg>
<seg id="19">At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape, against Kavanaugh, which he denies.</seg>
<seg id="20">Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who say they themselves experienced sexual assault confronted him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.</seg>

<seg id="2">His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.</seg>
<seg id="3">You have to look twice: Yes, that really is Florian David Fitz.</seg>
<seg id="4">The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!</seg>
<seg id="5">Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by NDR, is known for cheerful conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten."</seg>
<seg id="6">Presenter Ina Müller toasts with her guests some beer, some wine or even high-percentage drinks in order to loosen up the mood and tongues.</seg>
<seg id="7">Quite a few celebrities also drink themselves into the ground for the obligatory singing sessions.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was taped.</seg>
<seg id="9">This time around: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts," "Terror - Your Judgment" and "The Horniest Day."</seg>
<seg id="10">But the trip to the far north did not go well for the Munich native.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face completely crumpled on it, his eyes just two small slits.</seg>
<seg id="12">The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he's not sick, he just has a powerful hangover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he has now gained: 'Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rule two: never drink the black sow.</seg>
<seg id="16">And spritz.</seg>
<seg id="17">And leave out the round of eggnog, which Ina throws at half past three.</seg>
<seg id="18">Alcohol consumption is written all over the 43-year-old's face.</seg>
<seg id="19">His fans immediately posted a few tips on how to combat the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="20">They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably most purposefully - headache tablets.</seg>
<seg id="21">Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive movie star.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the night-time binge.</seg>

<seg id="2">The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in Red Riding Hood Land in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.</seg>
<seg id="3">Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are few and far between.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and debris, demolished bins and meanwhile dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the showpiece railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood country a more than inglorious sight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The topic has been occupying members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the city's cycling commissioner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The issue had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="8">So far, there is no solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste bins and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," Wüstenhagen says.</seg>
<seg id="11">Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the topic to the local advisory board.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating area is a regular meeting place for partying at weekends.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not only is it often loud, the banquets also destroy: posts are torn out of the ground, rubbish bins are demolished, signs are bent over, seating furniture is smeared.</seg>
<seg id="14">Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="16">They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for binge drinking.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling centre in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.</seg>
<seg id="18">'If she suffers the same fate, it's going to be really expensive. '</seg>
<seg id="19">Another idea, he said, is video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe that sets the threshold much higher for seizing public property.</seg>
<seg id="20">This would, however, require a police patrol to pass by in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="21">In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to see the development of the Haaße Hill.</seg>
<seg id="22">It needs to be made more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="23">One can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.</seg>
<seg id="24">The tourism marketing is still expandable.</seg>
<seg id="25">Our bike path is of a very high quality compared to others in Germany, "says the ADFC members.</seg>
<seg id="26">ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be an extremely critical danger point.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is no turning track on the Haaße hill.</seg>
<seg id="28">In heavy traffic it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic on both sides, "she explains.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for older people and especially for children.</seg>

<seg id="6">Seven groups competed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albachtener who lived for a long time in Hiltrup, the nine from the "Hiltruper Sternfarben," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.</seg>
<seg id="7">This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="8">We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="9">What did the copywriters see themselves associated with?</seg>
<seg id="10">With the places the Hiltruper lake and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly frequently.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.</seg>
<seg id="13">Again and again, it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.</seg>
<seg id="14">Karl Franke animated the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.</seg>
<seg id="15">So it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.</seg>
<seg id="16">Franke reported from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="17">And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has put all sorts of things on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's not about winning," Franke had said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper catering trade.</seg>
<seg id="20">Still, there was something special for the judges "favorites - so that others could hear their songs, too.</seg>
<seg id="21">An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two kindergarten teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.</seg>
<seg id="23">Like everyone else, the children performed again for the finale - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good," as Franke said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.</seg>
<seg id="25">The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">The district offensive had brought the event to life on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="27">She rated the event as a complete success.</seg>
<seg id="28">Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon-to-be very crowded Kulturbahnhof.</seg>

<seg id="1">The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test</seg>
<seg id="2">The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.</seg>
<seg id="3">For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered once you have put them in.</seg>
<seg id="4">This ensures that the other side cannot read anything, even by mistake.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cards then read, for example, from left to right: "1. Renaissance.</seg>
<seg id="6">2nd window.</seg>
<seg id="7">3rd cube.</seg>
<seg id="8">4. Fest. "</seg>
<seg id="9">These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.</seg>
<seg id="10">For it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Alternately, one player per team is the encrypter.</seg>
<seg id="12">He gets a code card that perhaps says "3.4.2."</seg>
<seg id="13">What is to be guessed in "Decrypto" is not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.</seg>
<seg id="14">His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "dice," "fixed" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team, if possible, does not; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.</seg>
<seg id="15">The encrypter thus notes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the lintel there.</seg>
<seg id="16">So it goes on round by round, team by team.</seg>
<seg id="17">You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can rhyme them better with every hint the encrypter gives there.</seg>
<seg id="18">So the paraphrases should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.</seg>
<seg id="19">Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.</seg>
<seg id="20">The players probably have to study it quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.</seg>
<seg id="21">The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.</seg>
<seg id="22">But once you get started, it will be fascinating to see how much emotion there is in this unassuming game.</seg>
<seg id="23">All in all, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre prime "Codenames," which also applies an agent theme to a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.</seg>
<seg id="24">And if you're only interested in guessing and not winning points, you can easily come up with a version for two.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pressig depot was the home of the push-pull engines</seg>
<seg id="2">For decades, the railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Franconian Forest.</seg>
<seg id="3">A piece of railway history ended in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="4">"When buffers popped against buffers, you could hear it all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the railway station.</seg>
<seg id="5">No one was upset by that.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then the brakes squealed and the wagons rattled.</seg>
<seg id="7">That was just pure railway.</seg>
<seg id="8">Statements that are emblematic of Dinkel's homeland Pressig.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nowhere in the Franconian Forest has a place been so shaped by the railway.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its apex in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres in altitude.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to cope with this, train and drawer locomotives used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, catenary and railway maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The centrepiece was the turntable, which, after a conversion in 1899, had a diameter of 18 metres," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and professional railway worker for 47 years.</seg>
<seg id="14">The railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.</seg>
<seg id="15">On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160; 13 steam and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.</seg>
<seg id="16">The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimised the need for train and push locomotives.</seg>
<seg id="17">From 1977, they were only used for freight trains.</seg>
<seg id="18">Until 1991, at least 10 000 wagons were still manoeuvred per month.</seg>
<seg id="19">Parts of the plant were demolished in 1982 and the rest in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="20">Heidrich: "It is regrettable that a better use of the site has not been envisaged, including in terms of freight transport."</seg>
<seg id="21">On Whitsun 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" with a pompous station party in Pressig.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">A short time later, the end.</seg>
<seg id="24">On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling yard was history.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The shunting and shoe-laying workers did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.</seg>
<seg id="26">Any misstep would have had fatal consequences.</seg>

<seg id="1">As part of the series "Art and Pleasure," a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="2">It was with great relief that organisers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.</seg>
<seg id="3">It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss."</seg>
<seg id="4">It opened its doors in the 15th year.</seg>
<seg id="5">A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="6">Twenty-one copies by 20 artists are now on display in Mittelehrenbach.</seg>
<seg id="7">The host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself has been there since the first hour.</seg>
<seg id="9">As did Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as both the main organizer and the artist.</seg>
<seg id="10">Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="11">With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Both have been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have helped to design flyers.</seg>
<seg id="13">This year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there will once again be a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.</seg>
<seg id="14">This year's poster "Betzn auPunching," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="16">Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won over for the musical accompaniment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Walking through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Wind Chime Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.</seg>
<seg id="18">They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.</seg>
<seg id="19">Already at the entrance of the estate, the "lucky tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, awaits the visitor on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a tree stump, brightened up in colour, playfully provided with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.</seg>
<seg id="21">With the sun flashing through the bushes in the background, the object looks magically pensive and invites you to linger.</seg>
<seg id="22">From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself to the event 15 years K & G in three-dimensional letters.</seg>
<seg id="23">There are many parts, in motion in the wind.</seg>
<seg id="24">Half way through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."</seg>
<seg id="25">And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy structure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.</seg>
<seg id="26">The theme "Wind Chime Performance" invites you to stroll through the multi-faceted art exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="27">The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1">50 years of MGV 68 albums: Singers celebrate 50th birthday</seg>
<seg id="2">1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.</seg>
<seg id="3">And the Albachians also expressed their displeasure at the time.</seg>
<seg id="4">At least five of them.</seg>
<seg id="5">They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that, after the dissolution of the church choir "Cecilia," there would no longer be a singing life in the district.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbush they launched the MGV 68 nightmares.</seg>
<seg id="7">That was 50 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now the anniversary was celebrated in a big way in the "House of Encounter."</seg>
<seg id="9">"It will be full today," anticipated chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.</seg>
<seg id="10">There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.</seg>
<seg id="12">For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.</seg>
<seg id="14">An elegant ball it became, festive attire had previously been asked for.</seg>
<seg id="15">The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter," but sat comfortably at tables.</seg>
<seg id="16">In between, movement was the order of the day: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked to take to the dance floor.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 albums let the voice ring out themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">In keeping with the occasion, cheerful songs were announced.</seg>
<seg id="19">Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today."</seg>
<seg id="20">To match the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine."</seg>
<seg id="21">In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus," which is the Latin name for "hops," was heard.</seg>
<seg id="22">The choral direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was once again sovereign.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said: "He has such an easy manner, it's a feat he accomplishes." By the way, this time it wasn't just men who presented themselves as singers.</seg>
<seg id="24">The ladies "choir" Hohes C, "whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s, was also a guest.</seg>
<seg id="25">Finally, there was poetry.</seg>
<seg id="26">Singer Theo Weber had sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.</seg>
<seg id="27">And Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.</seg>
<seg id="28">There was also a big raffle.</seg>
<seg id="29">The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.</seg>

<seg id="2">The rising star is marching.</seg>
<seg id="3">Three games, three wins - the reserve team of USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is getting along really well in League Three.</seg>
<seg id="4">No hint of shyness or tailgating, the independents are doing their thing.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that in the 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city rival BW Aasee really well.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It wasn't crystal clear, but we made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.</seg>
<seg id="7">BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are not unhappy. "On the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the evening at a later birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the atmosphere was good, the game ticked off.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.</seg>
<seg id="11">The visitors had a set point in the third set.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If they bring it to the finish, a game like this can tip over," Büring knows from years of experience.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the end, USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish.</seg>
<seg id="14">'We're all aware of who's on the other side in a derby like this.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't break our neck.</seg>
<seg id="16">I saw some really good volleys, "Annacker said of the 0-3 draw - and immediately went back to business as usual.</seg>
<seg id="17">After just three days of play, it seems impossible to predict where the independents will go.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only in one sense does he feel vindicated: "The third division has an incredibly good level.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball. "In any case, they no longer want to look down into the fourth division.</seg>
<seg id="21">If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, a first assessment can only be made after ten or eleven games.</seg>
<seg id="23">On Saturday we will first go to Emlichheim.</seg>
<seg id="24">Aasee will compete in Essen on 14 October.</seg>

<seg id="1">On her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband</seg>
<seg id="2">Heide Keller became a star on the "Dream Ship."</seg>
<seg id="3">Now she has spoken candidly about how the show may have been partly to blame for her marriage breakdown to Hans von Borsody.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left the ship for good.</seg>
<seg id="5">The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she was married for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="6">'That could've been one of the reasons.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because I grew up with this work, travelled the world alone with a suitcase, and many colleagues I admired perceived me at eye level, "Keller says in an interview with" Bild am Sonntag. "</seg>
<seg id="8">At first she had only ever been "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that had changed with the "dream ship."</seg>
<seg id="9">For now, the journalists only called Heide Keller.</seg>
<seg id="10">'I don't know if he liked it that much. '</seg>
<seg id="11">She thinks it's possible that her then-husband might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans shied away from talking about problems and feelings."</seg>
<seg id="12">Keller had always tried to be "the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="13">In plain English, this means: I have disguised myself, "she continues.</seg>
<seg id="14">She had always felt she was "not good enough for him.</seg>
<seg id="15">He saw me as an emancipated woman who, in truth, I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.</seg>
<seg id="16">I wanted our love to be forever. "</seg>
<seg id="17">After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "even though I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time."</seg>
<seg id="18">The day before the civil ceremony I sat crying in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.</seg>
<seg id="19">The marriage to von Borsody also failed.</seg>
<seg id="20">Why did it never work out with the men?</seg>
<seg id="21">Because I wanted too much.</seg>
<seg id="22">Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.</seg>
<seg id="24">I've been too naive in my approach to love. '</seg>

<seg id="1">The moth, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.</seg>
<seg id="2">Our moth is not a moth, but it is a little shy of light.</seg>
<seg id="3">And the glare, in which a green carpet on Sechseläutenplatz is bathed, blinds him unduly.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to bask in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="5">So on this late Thursday evening, he staggers across the square to relieve himself briefly in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oasis."</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the care facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion goes to great lengths to exude a luxurious ambience.</seg>
<seg id="7">But this evening, for some reason, it stinks to heaven in the men's oasis.</seg>
<seg id="8">So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just been entertained at the best level by the opening film "Green Book" in the cinema next door, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store as every year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as is well known, the works on display come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">What do you not have to come up with in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies.</seg>

<seg id="2">Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His charges were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.</seg>
<seg id="3">They had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly for long periods, the broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only the initial phase "we totally slept over," annoyed the ASV coach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The hosts quickly led 8-1, and even the early break Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit at first.</seg>
<seg id="6">"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the break, the deficit was only two goals.</seg>
<seg id="8">In particular, Sending's best man, Marius Hintze, arrived at the stage one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the change it got even better from a visitor's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="10">After 33 minutes David Ernst equalised to make it 15-15, after which the relay changer led almost all the way.</seg>
<seg id="11">Four minutes before the siren, the margin was still a seemingly reassuring three goals (29-26).</seg>
<seg id="12">And then?</seg>
<seg id="13">Let the impartial get in on the action.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bieletzki is usually wary of blaming others.</seg>
<seg id="15">But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received "was a joke."</seg>
<seg id="16">LIT had a good laugh and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">The boys fought really well, stood up well at the back against seven men and kept throwing at the empty goal.</seg>
<seg id="18">Only they can buy little for the compliments.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Now we have to get a damn victory," said Bieletzki, a full-back.</seg>
<seg id="20">ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (Hof County), police are searching for the woman's remains.</seg>
<seg id="3">Emergency workers dug up a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The road surface and several layers underneath were removed, the police and prosecutor's office said in a joint statement.</seg>

<seg id="6">The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.</seg>
<seg id="7">Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since last year, the Hof criminal police have been working intensively on the case together with the public prosecutor's office, according to the information.</seg>
<seg id="9">Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators used a ground radar to find an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün.</seg>
<seg id="10">With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officers limited the area to a few metres.</seg>

<seg id="1">Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as boss of the billionaire firm.</seg>
<seg id="2">He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission settled out of court a lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will each pay $20 million, and Musk will also step down as chairman for three years, a position similar to that of the German supervisory board chief.</seg>
<seg id="4">By contrast, he is allowed to remain chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.</seg>

<seg id="10">He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.</seg>
<seg id="11">On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market, paying $420 a share, with financing secured.</seg>
<seg id="12">That would have valued Tesla at a total of $72 billion.</seg>

<seg id="2">After the squabbles of the past few weeks, GroKo is cashing in on several poll lows.</seg>
<seg id="3">The SPD falls behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is seen as critical.</seg>
<seg id="4">Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday poll for Bild am Sonntag.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the weekly poll conducted by the polling institute, the AfD gained one point to 17 percent, while the SPD dropped one point compared to the previous week and ended up with 16 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">The CDU and CSU also lose one point, coming in at just 27 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the lowest level for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Greens get 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="9">If there were a federal election on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would together receive only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, the grand coalition has now lost the majority on the Sunday question in all the major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.</seg>
<seg id="11">The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).</seg>
<seg id="12">In the 2017 federal election, they received a combined 53.4 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="13">For the other parties, the range is also wide: the AfD, the second largest party in several polls, comes in at 15 to 18 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Greens have 12.5 to 17 per cent of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left is on average 10 per cent, the FDP 9 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the share of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="17">But popular support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.</seg>
<seg id="18">Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think that Merkel is the right person to be chancellor, according to the Emnid poll conducted on behalf of BamS.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to the survey, only one in two (50 per cent) currently wants the grand coalition to last until the next regular federal election in three years, while 41 per cent are in favour of a new election.</seg>
<seg id="20">Another poll released on Saturday also showed a marked drop in Merkel's popularity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Germans are also divided over whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to Emnid, 47 per cent are in favour and 44 per cent against.</seg>
<seg id="23">Among Union supporters, 64 percent would like to be a candidate, while 35 percent would not.</seg>

<seg id="2">There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch took a hard line with his own.</seg>
<seg id="3">He gave himself sparse words, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, withdrew at first (inwardly), in order to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.</seg>
<seg id="4">All history.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the meantime it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.</seg>

<seg id="9">That was impressive, "Fetsch praised his boys and went to each and every one of them after the match to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came in for him - the 4-4-2 changed almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for balls.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wolbeck had a lot more play in the first period.</seg>
<seg id="13">And opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Frerichs before his retirement (17th), the replaced Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.</seg>
<seg id="15">It almost paid off when, in minute 41, the SCA struck twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer in front of the Wolbeck box - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.</seg>

<seg id="22">Westhues "right-footed shot struck the bottom left corner from the marksman's point of view - 1-0 (71.).</seg>
<seg id="23">20 minutes left, which should be a hell of a long time.</seg>

<seg id="2">As of September 1, only 8 percent of the board members were female, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was available in advance to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them by," said Wiebke Ankersen, managing director of the foundation.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, all-male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.</seg>
<seg id="5">In comparison, the gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's a different corporate culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies can be attributed solely to positive impulses among the companies in the index of medium-sized stocks (MDax).</seg>
<seg id="8">True, according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most recently, 26 women served on the boards.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit women more consistently in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to make a voluntary commitment to increase the share from "zero percent" to date.</seg>
<seg id="14">A different picture emerges with regard to the supervisory boards: as of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">"If the same number of women were recruited to the boards each year, the proportion would reach 40 per cent by 2023," the report said.</seg>

<seg id="2">After their embarrassing exit in the League Cup, Manchester United are now also losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="3">Against West Ham United, ManU lost 1-3. The manner of the defeat should still give something to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="4">The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, when the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham to make it 3-1, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Suspecting an offside on Mark Noble's pass, all the Manchester City defenders stopped and gave Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.</seg>
<seg id="6">This was the negative climax of a performance that had already been inadequate for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mood at United's city rivals Manchester City is very different at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's great rival Pep Guardiola, cruised to a comfortable 2-0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion.</seg>
<seg id="9">After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the home team's defence for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former scorer, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and with it the jump to the top of the table.</seg>
<seg id="11">Liverpool no longer league leaders</seg>
<seg id="12">Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri scored for Liverpool in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea in the Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="13">As with the Cup exit, Belgium's Eden Hazard was the best man for the Londoners.</seg>
<seg id="14">The 27-year-old's goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the closing stages.</seg>
<seg id="15">Shaqiri, who came on for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Daniel Sturridge did better with his flick in the 89th minute.</seg>
<seg id="17">After the Reds had started the week with an unblemished record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="18">First, the Londoners eliminated Jurgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and the draw in the league saw the Blues topple Liverpool from the top of the table.</seg>
<seg id="19">Like City, the two London clubs Tottenham (at Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the Gunners fans, led by Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for a result against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire.</seg>
<seg id="21">With nine minutes to go, Watford defender Craig Cathcart was unfortunate to concede an own goal from Alex Iwobi, only for Mesut Özil to score his third goal of the season just two minutes later.</seg>
<seg id="22">Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to a fifth successive win and are now just behind big rivals Tottenham in fifth place, while promoted Wolverhampton continue to make a strong impression under their Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wolves remained unbeaten in the league for the fifth year in a row with a 2-0 win over Southampton and are in eighth place.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="3">Paris - Officially not an issue, but still omnipresent: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="4">Together with competitors from all over the world, they will be showcasing their new products at the 2018 Motor Show in the French capital from next week.</seg>
<seg id="5">The diesel doesn't really play a big role any more.</seg>
<seg id="6">The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, are nevertheless likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shiny scenes of the trade fair stands.</seg>
<seg id="7">A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core VW brand itself.</seg>
<seg id="8">Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here with, among other things, their first all-electric models: the e-tron from Ingolstadt is due to hit the market at the end of the year, and the EQC from Stuttgart in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="9">But both have already been officially presented.</seg>
<seg id="10">BMW's iNext is not due to launch until 2021.</seg>
<seg id="11">The focus in Paris is on the new 3-series.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.</seg>
<seg id="14">The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.</seg>

<seg id="2">And Borisch was also active during the actual day of action.</seg>
<seg id="3">She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his amazed spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.</seg>
<seg id="6">From time to time Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples into the large funnel.</seg>
<seg id="7">With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would one day become a tasty drink.</seg>
<seg id="9">But they were also able to look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="10">Packed into moulds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which looked a little like chopping material, layer by layer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the final work step was no longer so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="12">The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.</seg>

<seg id="1">1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth bankruptcy of the season: "Crappy situation"</seg>
<seg id="2">Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and encouraged them.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, there was not much positive to see in the 1: 4 (0: 2) of last place in the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It's a crappy situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-year-old professional football player Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "Of course it's disappointing, because you always put a lot of effort into it."</seg>
<seg id="5">The further winless Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86.) scored, stand with two points at the bottom and are in their current condition a relegation candidate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, however, Frankfurt celebrated their first home win of the season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45. + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of a crowd of 46,300. After the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League game against Lazio Rom, he advanced to the middle of the table with seven points.</seg>
<seg id="8">Croatia's World Cup runner-up Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous attacking move on his debut and was never able to get a grip on Hannover's defence.</seg>
<seg id="9">The striker, long out of action after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable to Eintracht.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was in the starting line-up for the first time for the Frankfurt side, who started brightly.</seg>
<seg id="11">A header from Lucas Torró (17th) deflected into the net brought danger for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="12">Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position, was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-lived Kevin Wimmer (back).</seg>
<seg id="13">The lead for the hosts was almost inevitable and fully deserved.</seg>
<seg id="14">Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended his header in front of goal, where Ndicka only had to put his foot down.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender, who joined from French second division side AJ Auxerre in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="16">And Frankfurt eased up before the break.</seg>
<seg id="17">This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully tanked his way through and gave 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.</seg>
<seg id="18">At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the poor performance of his team and brought in two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Lower Saxony played now somewhat more courageously forward, igniting ideas remained however until shortly before the end, when at least the follow-up goal succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Hessians were much more efficient there.</seg>
<seg id="21">After just under an hour Rebic launched a solo and then laid across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.</seg>
<seg id="22">The rest was just a show for the Frankfurt side against overwhelmed visitors, with Jovic also scoring with a minute to go.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Catholics of Geising celebrate the feast of the Holy Cross on 14 September or the Sunday after.</seg>
<seg id="3">The festive service will take place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, which dates back to the Thirty Years War and which, according to legend, was shot at by a Swedish soldier.</seg>
<seg id="5">Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.</seg>
<seg id="6">This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not finished until today, only the sanctuary is standing, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his homily, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite its importance for the Geising parish, the service was poorly attended.</seg>
<seg id="10">After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and the ecclesiastical part of the Feast of the Cross ended with the final blessing.</seg>
<seg id="11">For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish hall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather-adapted, farm ice cream.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church. On behalf of the parish, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction work, which will continue into next year.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, it has been possible to determine the damage more precisely and to prepare the individual tenders more specifically.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been discovered, which was only made possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.</seg>
<seg id="16">The base plastering work has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before the winter and it is hoped that a good half of this work will be completed this year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inauguration: New residence hall in the Neu-Ulm Münsterblickstraße</seg>
<seg id="2">The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller is opening a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.</seg>
<seg id="3">All those present at the inauguration agreed that "a very special house" will now be handed over to its purpose in Münsterblickstraße.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence hall of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas were taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officers "building of the US Army was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap:" The house was getting old and out of date in terms of equipment, "Bader explained in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="7">In 2016, the diggers moved in to demolish the house.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residence hall</seg>
<seg id="10">Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="13">The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.</seg>
<seg id="14">The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction has not always been easy.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom of being able to move without outside help.</seg>
<seg id="16">The head of the social administration of the Swabian district, Gertrud Kreutmayer, made a similar comment: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."</seg>
<seg id="17">The cosiness and functionality have been well combined, Kreutmayer said.</seg>
<seg id="18">And further: "The property in this situation is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in this way in the current situation."</seg>
<seg id="19">In total, the new residence hall in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on an area of almost 1500 square metres, divided into three residential groups.</seg>
<seg id="20">Heinz, managing director of Lebenshilfe, is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a tariff basis.</seg>

<seg id="2">What is Austria?</seg>
<seg id="3">On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director General of the Austrian State Archives, takes a very different approach in the magnificent "Picture Book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.</seg>

<seg id="1">New week, new opportunity for the government</seg>
<seg id="2">Back to business as usual - that is the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition's working week, which begins today.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not conjure up the mantra of a "return to business as usual."</seg>
<seg id="4">This may have led some craftsmen, women doctors, cashiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and professional work, but so be it.</seg>
<seg id="5">If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mission - to govern - it should not now be prevented from doing so by debating concepts.</seg>
<seg id="6">Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks will probably be shown as early as Monday.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.</seg>
<seg id="8">German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all this dispute.</seg>
<seg id="9">First, however, with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labour immigration law, conflicting issues are once again on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="10">CSU transport minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get off lightly with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart on the planned skilled migration law.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD is calling for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or undergoing training.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.</seg>
<seg id="14">So there will be another row among the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="15">Not Equal and Equal has joined forces to form GroKo, but three partners with, in some cases, very different views of society and priorities.</seg>
<seg id="16">Controversy is good.</seg>
<seg id="17">Without dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes conflicting interests cannot move forward.</seg>
<seg id="18">In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not again be exaggerated for party-tactical reasons into the question of being or not being.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is still about politics, not theatre.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Union and the SPD should argue - but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.</seg>
<seg id="21">What is feasible and good for many?</seg>
<seg id="22">With this key question, both the diesel and lane change issues can be resolved pragmatically - and thus confidence can be regained.</seg>
<seg id="23">Above all, that is what the people's parties must fight for now.</seg>

<seg id="1">Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary</seg>
<seg id="2">Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence referendum.</seg>
<seg id="3">But even before that, there are riots.</seg>
<seg id="4">The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Barcelona - Clashes between separatists and police broke out in central Barcelona on the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence protesters with paint powder, among other things, as they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and Civil Guard.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to hold a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed at polling stations during last year's referendum, which was deemed illegal.</seg>
<seg id="8">There had also been violence at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.</seg>
<seg id="9">Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.</seg>
<seg id="11">Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing authorities.</seg>
<seg id="12">Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under receivership in the autumn of 2017.</seg>
<seg id="14">The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.</seg>
<seg id="15">Other politicians have also moved abroad.</seg>
<seg id="16">Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, remain in custody.</seg>
<seg id="17">New elections were held in the region in December.</seg>
<seg id="18">After the new Catalan government took office in May, sequestration was brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.</seg>

<seg id="1">Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen part ways without a goal</seg>
<seg id="2">Red-and-white awls continue to appear on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="3">Even at FC Gütersloh it was only enough for a 0-0 draw.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a crowd of 438 in the Heidewald Stadium, they turned out to be helpless at the end and the third last.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first half was poor from the entertainment point of view.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those who therefore preferred to get a beer or a sausage, could do so without worry.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was no danger of missing a scoring chance because there were virtually none.</seg>
<seg id="8">First shot after half an hour</seg>
<seg id="9">Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal of the entire match in the 28th minute.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ahlener had the best - and in principle the only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade with a shot from the penalty area after 32 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hosts were even more innocuous.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their most effective action was to make an early change.</seg>
<seg id="13">Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came in for him.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel took aim from 18 metres just above the box and after an hour the Gütersloh players also made their first offensive appearance.</seg>
<seg id="16">After a conquest of the ball by Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the briskly presented counter-attack over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, they followed up with a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from former Ahlener Tim Manstein.</seg>
<seg id="19">RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing in Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).</seg>
<seg id="20">It made a difference - nothing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Ahlens did not achieve more than visual superiority thanks to their own initiative.</seg>
<seg id="22">It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had his last chance, but even that came to nothing.</seg>
<seg id="23">Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positives afterwards: "I like the fact that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero was also in front.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent had no desire to play here," stated RW Ahlen's interim coach.</seg>
<seg id="25">Offensively, "everything was rippling a little bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend.</seg>
<seg id="26">In any case, I didn't feel we could get a goal against them, "Daut said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Unfortunately for him, as a spectator, you did not feel as if his team could score a goal.</seg>
<seg id="28">The performance was too poor for that.</seg>

<seg id="4">At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the square was still a bit empty, but that was to change during the day.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's so sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.</seg>

<seg id="25">Honey cake in a jar, of course with honey from my own production.</seg>
<seg id="26">Little Elsa had to grab it again and again, that's how good the cake tasted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Smears with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate park</seg>
<seg id="2">In Lengerich, unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate park in a hardly conducive way.</seg>
<seg id="3">In several places there are corresponding smears, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on request of the WN.</seg>
<seg id="4">In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.</seg>
<seg id="5">The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are emblazoned in large letters on signs at, among others, the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="6">Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt Bistro had already been discovered after the vocational election fair on 19 September.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an edding at the time, it could easily have been removed.</seg>
<seg id="8">"A few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed on," Rottmann said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He assumes that the relevant advertising sign will have to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="10">A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.</seg>
<seg id="11">If the skate park is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies that appear on the smeared board.</seg>
<seg id="14">Local politics and administration have been dealing with the issue of skate parks for years.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the end, the majority of the council voted in favour of the fire station car park.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building at this point.</seg>
<seg id="18">A U-turn followed at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="19">The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously in favour of the Gutenberg School site.</seg>
<seg id="20">Jürgen Kohne says about the current state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city council would then have the final say.</seg>
<seg id="22">He said he expects a decision to be made this year so that if there is a yes vote, construction could begin in 2019.</seg>

<seg id="1">Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse</seg>
<seg id="2">Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm will come," the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.</seg>
<seg id="4">An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of staff at European air traffic control services, for which there is no quick solution.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but it takes four to five years to train new controllers," the union official said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Across Europe, the market for fully trained air traffic controllers has been emptied.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the center of Karlsruhe alone for the surveillance of the upper German airspace about a hundred people were missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maas again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.</seg>
<seg id="9">Representatives of the federal government, the federal states, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.</seg>
<seg id="10">"If you want to talk about additional compression of work and overtime, it will not be possible without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control company.</seg>
<seg id="11">Maas again blamed guidelines from the EU Commission for the pilot's plight.</seg>
<seg id="12">Transport forecasts for the regulatory period, which runs until 2019, were far too low.</seg>
<seg id="13">The resulting cost targets and staff savings at national air navigation services are now having a full impact on the operational business.</seg>
<seg id="14">Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to lobby in Brussels for regulations that "do not further restrict air traffic control services."</seg>
<seg id="15">Currently, the EU guidelines are being coordinated until 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said the EU was under constant pressure from airlines to lobby.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said he hoped the high cost of delays would prompt a rethink by airlines.</seg>
<seg id="19">The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," Maas said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The admission of 120 pilot pupils annually over the next five years, announced so far, is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.</seg>
<seg id="21">The necessary personnel build-up is not yet connected with this.</seg>

<seg id="2">Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan pro-independence demonstrators in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes, with many injured.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the municipality, about 3,000 police officers from across Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Catalan police had tried with a large contingent to keep the two protest marches away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="5">But pro-independence protesters repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier, according to the force.</seg>
<seg id="6">They allegedly attacked the officers with paint and projectiles.</seg>
<seg id="7">There were also scuffles between the participants of the various protest marches, according to the reports.</seg>
<seg id="8">Rescue workers said 24 people were injured.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police said there had been six arrests.</seg>
<seg id="10">Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues</seg>
<seg id="11">With their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had acted almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the same time they demanded better salaries.</seg>
<seg id="13">Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.</seg>
<seg id="14">The demonstrators saw it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked the AFP news agency.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they messed us up a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who wished to give his name only as Daniel, denied the charge.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year did only their duty: defend the law," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.</seg>
<seg id="20">But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the police officer said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Football: Juve coach praises Ronaldo's best game after top-flight match</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri, the Portuguese star striker "played the best game of the evening together with the half-hour of Valencia," after the record-breaking champions "3-1 win over Napoli.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the coach, even without an own goal, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important match against the chasing pack.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good with our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thanks to Ronaldo's three assists, Juve turned the game around after falling behind early on through a goal from Dries Mertens in the 10th minute and hung on for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="7">The scorer, brought in from Real Madrid, first laid on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double (26 / 49).</seg>
<seg id="8">And Ronaldo's header from a corner also set up a goal for defender Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in just before the goal-line.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He gives a lot of assists," praised the coach.</seg>
<seg id="10">But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently Juve's top scorer is Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three to his name.</seg>
<seg id="13">With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="14">Seven wins in seven games is an unblemished streak in Serie A. The champions of the past seven years are already six points clear of Napoli on 21 points.</seg>
<seg id="15">The second-placed side, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, were not without a chance against Torino.</seg>
<seg id="16">But at the latest after the dismissal of the already warned Mario Rui (58th), the top game was decided.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Portuguese was forced off the pitch with a yellow and red after going too hard on Paulo Dybala.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We played well against a good Napoli," the Turin coach said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emre Can has also been linked with a move.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Germany international has established himself at Juve.</seg>
<seg id="21">He has played in all seven of Liverpool's league games this season.</seg>
<seg id="22">The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri referred to as the "half hour": Ronaldo was sent off in the Turin side's 2-0 win and is suspended for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.</seg>

<seg id="8">SG also had only two chances in the first round, but Maik Krause took advantage of the first from an acute angle to take an early lead (7th).</seg>
<seg id="9">Steffen Uphus could have raised the score in the 43rd minute, but after great preparatory work by Krause he missed a free-kick.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hosts only had a double chance when Moritz Höne failed to connect with goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his way into the Sendenhorst keeper in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the break, the visitors became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.</seg>

<seg id="2">"I don't know what to make of it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We didn't get access to them at all." By which he presumably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kroeger, but probably also all the other green-whites who caught the eye with their collective offensive drive.</seg>
<seg id="4">Still, he was able to laugh: "A dirty win," he said, winking cheekily and pulling away from his players, but there was a sense of relief that they had pulled away with three points.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albacht, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for the league title.</seg>
<seg id="6">GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that lay behind him with understandably mixed feelings.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That was by far our best performance of the season," he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">'The way we came back from 0-2 down, the way we fought back throughout the game against one of the top teams in the league, it's been phenomenal. '</seg>
<seg id="9">This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Top scorer Lars Zymner gave the hosts the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24th).</seg>
<seg id="11">He needed exactly two touches of the ball in that game for that goal.</seg>
<seg id="12">He made it 2-0 via the left-hand side for Fabian Fröhning (39.).</seg>
<seg id="13">We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">'It was crazy what he did, 'Lewandowski said of the quality of his opponent.</seg>
<seg id="15">Just before the change of sides, his own team equalised: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long corner (45th).</seg>
<seg id="16">After the change of sides it was again McGill who scored the equaliser (59th).</seg>
<seg id="17">After that, it went back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was a crisp, action-packed game.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nübel shocked Albacht again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).</seg>
<seg id="20">Despite being outnumbered, Albersloh was not able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he will personally pick up the Tolerance Prize in Tutzing.</seg>
<seg id="4">The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: As Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.</seg>
<seg id="5">But before and after Wulff was there as a guest.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have already been with us." However, the fact that celebrities keep turning up at the Academy in Schloss Tutzing was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on 29 September the writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also confirmed that he will personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which will also be awarded to television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (as we reported).</seg>
<seg id="9">The 80 or so meetings up to mid-2019 have a lot to offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The pension is just not safe!" reads a conference title.</seg>
<seg id="11">"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."</seg>
<seg id="12">"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbarism without limit. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war makes a mockery of every humane idea. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical transformation of work through digitalisation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions, or at least partial solutions."</seg>
<seg id="16">At a meeting to mark the 200th anniversary of the</seg>
<seg id="17">s birthday, some expect more visitors to the direction of criticism of capitalism, while others expect a tendency "from the far left to the centre."</seg>
<seg id="18">What about neutrality?</seg>

<seg id="2">The musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck was "suitable for both adults and men."</seg>
<seg id="3">As a cabaret performer, Teubner buttoned up gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.</seg>
<seg id="4">She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the grand piano sat Ben Süverkrüp.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks right up to the end of the movement, and on the other, he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies with such congenial harmony that some may have wished for a solo.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was, too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, in the way that suited the theme of the evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction in a man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.</seg>
<seg id="9">A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.</seg>
<seg id="10">The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have emerged from Mozart's composing if "das Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod," and from Mozart's Symphony in G minor into a playful little dance.</seg>
<seg id="12">There was a huge round of applause and "Bravo" from the packed hall.</seg>
<seg id="13">Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.</seg>
<seg id="14">But chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not let herself be deprived of an additional thanks.</seg>
<seg id="15">She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.</seg>

<seg id="1">From pure fruit growing to ecology</seg>
<seg id="2">The 125-year anniversary of the district association for horticulture and land conservation was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.</seg>
<seg id="3">On 29 September 1893 the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbach club house, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbach town hall on Saturday evening.</seg>
<seg id="4">Admittedly, it had a different name at the time: it was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893 as the "District Fruit Building Association Kulmbach Stadt und Land."</seg>
<seg id="5">The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - in fact, it was purely about fruit-growing, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.</seg>
<seg id="6">"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained district home keeper Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fruit trees were to line trunk roads, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cultivation of fruit is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.</seg>
<seg id="9">But that is far from the end of the spectrum.</seg>
<seg id="10">A natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as the imparting of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.</seg>
<seg id="11">The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Moles" entertainingly demonstrated on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and Mayor Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.</seg>
<seg id="13">Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect as much joy with Smartphone & Co.</seg>
<seg id="14">Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner to mark the anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Where they should stand is decided by the district association," added District Administrator Söllner, stressing the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.</seg>
<seg id="16">The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun in no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="18">He led the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.</seg>
<seg id="19">Everything used to come from the garden, it was snowed in for the winter.</seg>
<seg id="20">By the end of the 1950s, however, the kitchen garden had been transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Nature is here to stay, it was there before us and we have to be guided by it," pleaded the expert for fruit and nut trees.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living in.</seg>
<seg id="23">This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower brass of the Thurnau Music Association.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: They are giving both trading partners an ultimatum to reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="3">Canada's foreign minister is now making the trade deal an absolute priority - and postponing her speech to the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="4">Due to time constraints in the struggle to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not address the United Nations General Assembly until Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the meantime, she said, she is focused on renegotiating Nafta.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said Friday that negotiators from Canada and the United States have 48 hours to reach an agreement if Canada really wants to join the trade deal already struck between its country and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">The US and Mexico agreed on a new version of the Nafta regional free trade agreement in August.</seg>
<seg id="9">US President Donald Trump has hinted that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">Talks on a new edition have been going on for more than a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">They are now due to be finalised by Sunday evening (local time), with Trump's administration aiming to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.</seg>
<seg id="12">If negotiations fail, Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.</seg>

<seg id="2">Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left hospital.</seg>
<seg id="3">The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report in the daily "O Globo."</seg>
<seg id="4">After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make any public appearances in the South American country in the final week before presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="5">The politician was attacked in the street during a campaign rally in southern Brazil in early September.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.</seg>
<seg id="7">Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.</seg>
<seg id="8">The associations also mobilized on social networks against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers "Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.</seg>
<seg id="11">He took the place of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brazil's presidential election is on October 7.</seg>
<seg id="13">As the ex-mayor of the metropolis of São Paulo, Haddad has been far behind far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.</seg>
<seg id="14">The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but now presents himself as an anti-system candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">If none of the candidates reaches an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a run-off on 28 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from it - no matter who he runs against.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bolsonaro is known for inciting against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).</seg>
<seg id="18">Again and again, he shocks with verbal slip-ups.</seg>
<seg id="19">On another occasion, he said supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.</seg>

<seg id="1">After a long illness: Danish rock legend has died</seg>
<seg id="2">Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.</seg>
<seg id="3">The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsen's website.</seg>
<seg id="4">At his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.</seg>
<seg id="5">The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Larsen had become well-known with the band Gasolin ', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the break-up of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as a solo artist.</seg>
<seg id="9">He sold around three million records in Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="10">His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a statement on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts."</seg>
<seg id="12">The prime minister also recalled that Larsen, an opponent of the monarchy, had performed at the 70th birthday of Denmark's Queen Margrethe II in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at jackhammer level</seg>
<seg id="2">"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three bands who are friends with each other.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was no sign of stage fright.</seg>
<seg id="5">Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - and their bands loudly inspire the 120 or so visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.</seg>
<seg id="6">Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with front man and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening also with newest, unknown pieces written by themselves and the soon to be released CD.</seg>
<seg id="7">In front of the stage, the audience dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although "encore" shouts can't be ignored, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."</seg>
<seg id="9">Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not the same as hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="10">After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers," "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.</seg>
<seg id="11">Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.</seg>
<seg id="12">The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, meanwhile, has gained a special degree of recognition since its foundation in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="13">Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="14">The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.</seg>
<seg id="15">Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in collaboration with the band on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the meantime guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo to the sound that feels even higher than before, whereby he runs through the audience.</seg>
<seg id="17">A certain volume is, of course, part of the genre at such a hard rock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing desk team, the three-way concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is approximately at the level of a pneumatic hammer, but is still significantly below the levels of the "Wacken Fesitval," which "The Ignition" refer to on their website.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deafening 120 decibels in jet engine volume as usual at the annual Metal rendezvous in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.</seg>
<seg id="20">After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking pace have long since convinced with their confident, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," can all three groups, admittedly in the figurative sense, say at the end.</seg>
<seg id="22">And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is no secret that the US president is sympathetic to North Korea's leader Kim, despite the nuclear crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, however, Trump has made a veritable declaration of love for his colleague.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."</seg>
<seg id="5">At the tender age of 72, the married US president has confessed to a new flame.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tragedy is that it is a long-distance relationship.</seg>
<seg id="7">In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump had almost tender words for the half-old scion of Pyongyang's ruling dynasty, even though he is proving to be quite a tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I was tough, so was he, and it went back and forth between us," Trump said.</seg>
<seg id="10">And then we fell in love.</seg>
<seg id="11">Okay?</seg>
<seg id="12">No, really.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it wasn't just the talks with Kim that would have melted his heart.</seg>
<seg id="14">He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far paid little more than lip service to it.</seg>
<seg id="16">The US president seemed well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - notorious for his martial threatening gestures might not be to everyone's taste.</seg>
<seg id="17">In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism when he appeared at a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."</seg>
<seg id="18">How terrible, how terrible is that?</seg>
<seg id="19">It's so unpresidential.</seg>
<seg id="20">But he didn't care, Trump said, then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidential."</seg>
<seg id="21">But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there cramming into this packed arena, we'd only have 200 people standing outside.</seg>

<seg id="2">Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to draw attention to their appalling conditions in detention in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.</seg>
<seg id="3">The group had filmed the footage in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July, risking their lives, and shared it online.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.</seg>
<seg id="5">We suffer here, we die here.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers," whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).</seg>
<seg id="7">The refugees were eventually flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told the AFP news agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said he put his life in danger with the video.</seg>
<seg id="11">One of his comrades was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.</seg>
<seg id="12">In general, the conditions of detention were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."</seg>
<seg id="13">They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="15">About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home through the program this year, said Jorge Galindo, an IOM spokesman in the West African country.</seg>
<seg id="16">The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="17">But he said he had not yet heard of a call for help via cell phone video.</seg>
<seg id="18">International organisations have long criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.</seg>
<seg id="19">The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.</seg>

<seg id="2">Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statement.</seg>
<seg id="3">Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after meeting Erdogan at Cologne airport.</seg>
<seg id="4">This concerns in particular waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Laschet, he also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="7">He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.</seg>
<seg id="8">Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="9">The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's flight readiness at Cologne airport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the castle had refused to do so out of political conviction against Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the talks, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.</seg>
<seg id="12">Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."</seg>

<seg id="2">While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the successes of negotiations on North Korea's denuclearization, the East Asian regime presents a more sober picture.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a concession from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the UN General Debate, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US government of using its continued sanctions to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The recent stalemate comes as the United States is relying on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.</seg>
<seg id="6">Under these circumstances, disarmament would be unthinkable for North Korea.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.</seg>
<seg id="8">That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who don't know us."</seg>
<seg id="9">To build trust, however, his country halted its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test site, Ri said.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, there has been no "corresponding reaction" from the US side, the minister criticised.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the UN Security Council adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.</seg>
<seg id="12">US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict compliance with the sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, the US government is working on rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="14">In June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang in October for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.</seg>

<seg id="3">The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="4">The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to say thank you with the food.</seg>
<seg id="5">The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.</seg>
<seg id="6">We had already filled our fridges with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.</seg>

<seg id="2">Borussia Monchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win at Wolfsburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">At 2-2, the Foals squander a two-run lead.</seg>
<seg id="4">Schalke get their first win of the season against Mainz (1-0).</seg>
<seg id="5">(sda) Schalke have been offside four times in their first five league games with early goals.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now Domenico Tedesco's team once again showed the strength with which they finished in first place behind Bayern last season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Alessandro Schöpf headed the home side into the lead in the eleventh minute after strong work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, and the hosts then preserved the mini-cushion with a compact defensive performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thanks to an extraordinary comeback Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lucien Favre's team had racked up a 0-2 deficit against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came back to win 4-2 in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) equalised with a double within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break with another double in the closing stages (86. / 94.).</seg>
<seg id="11">VfB Stuttgart also won for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="12">Against Werder Bremen, who had already been decimated before the break due to a yellow and red card against Milos Veljkovic, Stuttgart had to worry in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="13">Borna Sosa and inattentive goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious throw-in own goal that helped the visitors equalise in the 68th minute.</seg>
<seg id="14">Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led VfB to their first victory.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.</seg>
<seg id="16">The team from Gladbach with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang twice gave up a lead, finally played 2: 2 and are still waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="17">Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's equaliser in the 1-1 draw with his second Bundesliga goal.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yann Sommer was powerless with a low shot from 20 yards, just as he was with his second goal after an hour.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.</seg>
<seg id="20">Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.</seg>
<seg id="21">Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase, who came from OGC Nice, scored for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh game.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gladbach finished in 4th place after seven rounds.</seg>
<seg id="23">Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen manoeuvred themselves into an uncomfortable position against VfB Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="24">After 19 minutes Florian Kohlfeldt's team let themselves be surprised by a Stuttgart counter-attack, which ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season. After 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic added to his team: The 23-year-old Serb received a yellow-red after a jersey tug against Daniel Didavi.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought Bremen back into the game with a curious throw-in own goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the outnumbered Stuttgart back on the road to victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3: 0.</seg>
<seg id="27">After half an hour Hanno Behrens put the home team on course with a foul penalty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hertha bust: caught up with reality as Bayern take on Ajax</seg>
<seg id="2">The predicate of unbeatable is gone: the FC Bayern does not want to put up with the defeat in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="3">The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will now determine the first interim result of Niko Kovac's tenure.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first small dip in performance under new coach Niko Kovac should not be a major autumn low for the Munich-based side.</seg>
<seg id="5">"A week ago, people still had the impression that we were invincible.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now a bit of reality has caught up with us, "stated Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are stepping on the gas towards Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the first time in more than a year no own goal was scored away from home, as at the same time of the pre-season two obligatory games in a row without a win, lost the league lead in the Bundesliga to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although the overall situation is nowhere near as dramatic as it was at the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti era at the end of September 2017, the record signing still has to be warned.</seg>
<seg id="10">The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its running-intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berliners with their playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, how the recently overpowering Bavarians can be cracked after all.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not put up with this and we will do everything we can to be successful again," stressed Kovac.</seg>
<seg id="12">Apart from that, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his hometown and blamed his first defeat as Munich coach only on another poor handling of chances.</seg>
<seg id="13">A win against Amsterdam and against Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim result of his tenure positive before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures ahead of his second Premier League appearance of the season after the 2-0 defeat at Benfica Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation begins as planned for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, who also beat AEK Athens 3-0 in their opener.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will score again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.</seg>
<seg id="17">As was the case after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich in particular spoke clearly.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lawyer acted in the role of admonisher.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes at the back," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="20">On matchday seven of last season, Bayern were already five points behind Dortmund, who have now taken the lead again with a one-point advantage.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so Kimmich, with a twinkle in his eye, at least took a positive view that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bayern has now come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Yeah, that's a good thing," the international said.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's good for the league.</seg>

<seg id="2">With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">DFB president Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the FA line.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now a new post is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="5">Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for the sovereignty of interpretation in the long-running dispute over Mesut Özil.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the Turkish President strongly criticised the treatment of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the FA line.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the early hours of Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the cause in Mainz's ZDF "sports studio."</seg>
<seg id="8">"In the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migrant background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this will not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to recruit an international without a migrant background as another integration officer.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.</seg>
<seg id="10">He had strongly denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our Mesut Özil, who was born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.</seg>
<seg id="12">They excluded them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said Saturday in the cathedral city.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be honest, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the top of the German national team, were marginalised.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two of them with Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, he announced his intention to stand in front of players in the future.</seg>
<seg id="16">For someone to say: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.</seg>
<seg id="18">We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said that.</seg>
<seg id="19">But he also does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a consequence, in addition to Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," Grindel said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Despite the criticism of himself after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, he intends to run for president of the DFB again next year.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.</seg>

<seg id="2">About four weeks after the outbreak of the bog fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 firefighters are still working on the extinguishing work.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="4">As the situation continues to be stable, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="5">A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it says.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Sunday night, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last week, the disaster, which had been declared just over a week earlier on 21 September, was lifted because of fears that the flames were putting neighbouring forests and settlements at risk due to wind and flying sparks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thursday, it said the fire was no longer threatening to spread to neighboring communities.</seg>
<seg id="9">At times, more than 1,500 firefighters tried to get the blaze under control on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Air Force continues to support the work at the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.</seg>
<seg id="13">The fire was caused by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plume of smoke from the bog fire had at times travelled up to a hundred kilometres across the north-west of Germany as far as Bremen.</seg>

<seg id="2">The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.</seg>
<seg id="4">(AP) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.</seg>
<seg id="5">This should make organ donation easier and relieve relatives in stressful situations.</seg>
<seg id="6">People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.</seg>
<seg id="7">Your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="10">But only in five per cent of cases would a card be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.</seg>
<seg id="11">In more than 60 per cent of conversations, relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="12">"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful," Immer said.</seg>
<seg id="13">A similar registration system already exists in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Agency for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.</seg>
<seg id="15">"There is no register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Under his proposal, anyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless they or relatives object.</seg>
<seg id="18">Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.</seg>

<seg id="2">Schleswig-Holstein's farmers will be allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The "green ramparts," which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for around 200 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tree and undergrowth hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are a "forest substitute" and the last refuge for many animals and plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as Ingo Ludwichowski, managing director of the German Nature Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Knicks are living fences</seg>
<seg id="7">The Knicks were founded on an order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.</seg>
<seg id="8">The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.</seg>
<seg id="9">His name "Knick" also dates from that time: by "bending" the branches, the dense, intertwined demarcations were able to develop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the impression of a woody, variously structured landscape.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by around 7,000 animal species.</seg>
<seg id="12">Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre of bend and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.</seg>
<seg id="14">Otherwise, it atrophies to a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the Ministry of Agriculture, buckling care can only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.</seg>

<seg id="2">In an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), local resident Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:</seg>
<seg id="3">Have you been there yourself during the tsunami?</seg>
<seg id="4">No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.</seg>
<seg id="5">When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="7">I arrived there on Sunday morning, because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at that time.</seg>
<seg id="8">What is the situation on the island now?</seg>
<seg id="9">The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.</seg>
<seg id="12">Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Many have run to surrounding hills, where they are still holding out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water or food.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some are in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.</seg>
<seg id="16">The public service has been completely shut down, the national government is helping out.</seg>
<seg id="17">A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are walking around freely and the search for them is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.</seg>
<seg id="19">How does communication and information supply work on the island?</seg>
<seg id="20">At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it did not work and we only got information over the radio.</seg>
<seg id="21">Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who they do not know if they live or where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.</seg>
<seg id="22">The tsunami warning system did not work properly.</seg>
<seg id="23">Do you have any information?</seg>
<seg id="24">We don't know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear came, many thought, "Okay, no tsunami" - and then it came.</seg>
<seg id="25">In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.</seg>
<seg id="26">Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?</seg>
<seg id="27">Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.</seg>
<seg id="28">We usually know how to respond to earthquakes, and we also train evacuations.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.</seg>

<seg id="2">Time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interrogations is severely limited.</seg>
<seg id="3">With an FBI investigation underway, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a razor-thin majority for controversial Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on charges of coercion.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Donald Trump has given investigators until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents, which date back more than 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The latest twist in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appointment, which has been accompanied by a culture war, was triggered on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">After an eight-hour hearing between Kavanaugh and first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer launched angry tirades against opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was supposed to clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge to the US Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of Republicans seemed assured when, contrary to his initial announcement, Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared that he would vote yes, but demanded an FBI investigation.</seg>
<seg id="8">After tumultuous scenes, his fellow party members agreed.</seg>
<seg id="9">President Trump, who on Thursday referred to the serious allegations as "shit," initially refrained from further attacks on the women, instead calling them "bad luck."</seg>
<seg id="10">That way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is great relief at Schalke after their first win of the season.</seg>
<seg id="4">Against Mainz, however, the time factor also played a role.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gelsenkirchen - By now it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.</seg>
<seg id="7">'I've seen every ball in there.</seg>
<seg id="8">And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area, "said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the end, the royal blue managed to secure the narrow 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, things could have been different.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security Tedesco: "Overall, the first half was good, both in terms of play and in terms of pressing.," the head obviously played more and more a role as the game went on.</seg>
<seg id="12">Don't really create a header monster</seg>
<seg id="13">"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said. "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."</seg>
<seg id="14">The boys were afraid to let this get out of their hands and therefore withdrew further and further.</seg>
<seg id="15">And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.</seg>
<seg id="16">To save the first three points of the season.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We all fell a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who had no small part in this with his header goal: "I am actually the worst header player in the team."</seg>
<seg id="18">But in the end, only victory counts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The relief was palpable throughout the arena, including Tedesco, of course.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We wanted to start strongly in the early stages and make fireworks out of it," Schalke's head coach said.</seg>
<seg id="21">The win was important.</seg>
<seg id="22">Finally we can look forward to a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="23">I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.</seg>
<seg id="24">We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to approach games over 90 minutes</seg>
<seg id="25">Probably the biggest flaw of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed out on making for clearer conditions.</seg>
<seg id="26">The opportunities were finally there, such as the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice, or Amine Harit 62.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Then it wouldn't have been a shock win," Tedesco said: "You could feel the fear a little bit."</seg>
<seg id="28">So I'm glad we won.</seg>
<seg id="29">So he was not the only Schalke player.</seg>

<seg id="2">In front of them stands the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.</seg>
<seg id="3">He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organising the evening.</seg>
<seg id="5">El-Mafaalani goes into the reading very relaxed, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in an understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="6">With a lot of gestures, solid figures and the odd joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflict-ridden topics: migration and integration.</seg>
<seg id="7">Why do conflicts arise more and more despite successful integration?</seg>
<seg id="8">The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.</seg>
<seg id="9">At one table sits German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Their children grow up in Germany and want to come to the table.</seg>
<seg id="11">The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.</seg>
<seg id="12">This leads to conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decisive factor is therefore not whether one classifies oneself politically to the right or to the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?," he stresses.</seg>
<seg id="14">At first rather subdued, then the discussion gets off to an increasingly lively start.</seg>
<seg id="15">And there is a need to speak.</seg>
<seg id="16">An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.</seg>
<seg id="17">El-Mafaalani is standing in front, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on an equal footing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, stresses that he is talking about the average, not about individual fates.</seg>
<seg id="19">He is pleased that there is interest in the issue because "it is only when we understand what the problem is that we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.</seg>
<seg id="20">During the subsequent signing session, he still had an open ear for the questions of the guests and there was also intensive further discussion in the foyer with prepared Kurdish specialities.</seg>

<seg id="2">The purchasing managers "index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.</seg>
<seg id="3">Across Europe, Austria still has the third-best sentiment behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to Austria, the PMI for the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1, but the index is still below the 50-point mark indicating growth for the 13th month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only Ireland's industry broke that threshold in August, with 50.9 points.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the bottom were the Greeks (42.1 points).</seg>
<seg id="7">In Germany, France and Spain, the sentiment barometer fell, but at a slower pace than in previous months.</seg>
<seg id="8">In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, its highest level since March.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The slightly weakened dip may mean the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.</seg>
<seg id="10">But industry - in the third quarter at least - remains the number one drag on growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell at their fastest rate since November 2011.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="13">Industrial production in China also fell more sharply in August than initially thought.</seg>
<seg id="14">The sentiment barometer fell to 47.6 points from 49.3 points in the previous month.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Purchasing Managers Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.</seg>
<seg id="17">It covers, among other things, developments in turnover, employment, warehouses and prices.</seg>
